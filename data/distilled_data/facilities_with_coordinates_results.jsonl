The detainee stated the facility medical staff had given him pain pills, which he continued to take, and antibiotics for an infection from his teeth but he stopped taking because the pain subsided. However, the detainee also expressed the pain was persistent, and the facility medical staff had not informed the detainee whether his tooth extractions would take place. • Action Taken: ODO interviewed the health services administrator (HSA) and reviewed the detainee’s medical record. The detainee arrived at PPIPC on December 22, 2020, with a recent history of a tooth abscess and dental pain. He was taking an antibiotic for the infection and a nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory (NSAID) medication for pain. The facility’s registered nurse (RN) noted on the intake exam that the detainee had several cavities. In order to complete his course of treatment, the detainee was prescribed eight more days of the antibiotic and three days of the NSAID. On December 29, 2020, the physician completed the detainee’s medical history and physical exam and noted the detainee had a cracked tooth and referred him to a dentist. Additionally, the physician provided the detainee with a four-day supply of over the counter NSAID medication. From December 27, 2020, to February 2, 2021, the detainee submitted five sick call requests for dental pain. The detainee’s sick call requests were processed, and the detainee was evaluated within 24 hours by the facility’s RN using a standardized nursing protocol for dental pain. On four occasions between December 27, 2020, and February 2, 2021, the detainee was provided a three-day supply of over the counter NSAID medication to always keep with him, and on one occurrence he was supplied with a three-day course of Tylenol to always keep with him to help with the pain. However, since the detainee had cavities and a cracked tooth, the pain had not subsided. The four previous sick call encounters included documentation that the detainee was referred to a dentist and an appointment was pending. During the detainee’s sick call encounter on January 10, 2021, the facility’s RN wrote the detainee was to follow-up with the facility’s physician on January 12, 2021, and the facility’s dentist on January 19, 2021. According to the HSA, since PPIPC did not have on-site dental services, the detainee was scheduled to see a dentist in the community on January 19, 2021. However, prior to January 19th, the detainee was exposed to a positive COVID-19 case and had to be quarantined in his housing unit. During the initial two-week cohort period, several other detainees also tested positive, so the quarantine period was extended, and the detainee was not released from quarantine until February 14, 2021. The medical records technician (MRT) then scheduled the detainee for an emergent appointment with the dentist for February 17, 2021, but due to a storm prior to the inspection that caused power outages and water shut offs in the community, the dental office canceled all appointments. According the HSA, the detainee was informed a few days after the storm that his dental appointment would be rescheduled due to the recent inclement weather conditions and the closing of the dental office. From February 22-24, 2021, the MRT left several voicemail messages with the dental office to reschedule the appointment and was still waiting for a return call at the conclusion of the inspection.

As referenced earlier in this report, ODO interviewed two detainees who were unable to read the facility handbooks they were given. Also, in reviewing the facility’s admission practices, ODO identified five non-English/non-Spanish speaking detainees on the LPC daily roster. ODO found staff are not consistently indicating detainees’ preferred language on the admissions, general facility orientation, and PREA orientation paperwork. Specifically, the language preference for one Vietnamese national detainee was not listed on her orientation paperwork, and there was no indication interpretation services were provided to the detainee. ODO and the facility QA Manager spoke with the detainee and found she spoke very little English and does not speak Spanish. The QA Manager indicated he would conduct another orientation for the detainee using a language line. While ODO commends facility staff for acting quickly when inspectors brought these issues to their attention, ODO cites the inconsistency in providing language services to detainees as an Area of Concern19.

ODO observed Material Safety Data Sheets (MSDS) binders in the individual areas where hazardous chemicals were being used. ODO’s review of hazardous chemical storage areas in the laundry, food service and intake found inventory logs were not being maintained (Deficiency EH&S-27). The Dover Fire and Life Safety Inspector approved the SCDOC’s fire control and prevention plan on April 18, 2017. ODO reviewed available documentation and was unable to determine if fire drills are conducted at least quarterly in all areas and on each shift (Deficiency EH&S-38). The posted evacuation signs throughout the facility do not correlate to the locations in which they are posted and do not have “You Are Here” markers or the location of fire emergency equipment (Deficiency EH&S-49). Corrective action: The facility initiated corrective action during the inspection by placing the “You Are Here” markers on the exit maps and identifying the location of emergency equipment throughout the facility (C-1). ODO observed several of the fire extinguishers located throughout the facility had not been inspected each month (Deficiency EH&S-510).", "SECURITY": "ERO completes a Risk Classification Assessment (RCA) on every detainee which includes supervisory approval. ODO reviewed 25 randomly selected detainee files and verified each contained a completed RCA with background information. ERO is also responsible for reclassification. ODO’s review of files found that in most cases reclassification was completed within mandated timeframes; however, there were nine files which lacked documentation showing that reassessments were completed (Deficiency CS-111). ODO reviewed the housing roster, detention files, and observed detainees throughout the facility and found no evidence of prohibited co-mingling. However, while the standard requires level three (high level) detainees be escorted and monitored at all times, ODO observed high level detainees moving unescorted outside their assigned housing units (Deficiency CS-212). SCDOC policy and the detainee handbook provide information regarding the classification process and classification appeals. However, the detainee handbook does not educate detainees about either classification levels or the conditions and restrictions applicable to each (Deficiency CS-313).", "CARE": "ODO observed a clean-as-you-go program in place and cleaning schedules posted throughout food service areas. ODO found the overall sanitation of the kitchen and storage acceptable. Although ODO reviewed a monthly inspection sheet provided by staff, the facility was unable to provide documentation showing weekly sanitation inspections of the food service areas are conducted as required by the standard (Deficiency FS-126). During the inspection, ODO observed the Material Safety Data Sheets (MSDS) were present; however, chemicals used to maintain kitchen sanitation were not properly stored and inventories were not maintained (Deficiency FS-227)(R-5). The initial health appraisal for detainees is performed by trained nurses and reviewed by the physician. In three of the 25 medical records reviewed, ODO found health appraisals were not completed within 14 days of arrival at the facility (Deficiency MC-128). In all three cases, the health appraisals were performed in excess of 30 days after arrival. Timeliness of health appraisals is critical to ensure the health, safety, and well-being of detainees and staff. ODO found a different set of three detainees refused initial health appraisals, while three other detainees refused treatment deemed medically necessary for hypertension. Although the medical files reflected the detainees’ refusal, none of those individuals were referred to the physician or considered for segregation from the general population for medical reasons, in accordance with the standard. Nor was ERO consulted to determine if involuntary treatment should be pursued for the detainees refusing treatment (Deficiency MC-229). Corrective action: ODO requested the Health Service Administrator place the six detainees refusing health appraisals and treatment on the list to be evaluated by the physician during his next scheduled visit on July 20, 2017 (C-4). More than half of the ICE detainees ODO interviewed indicated they were charged to replace personal hygiene items through the commissary when their initial items were depleted. Interviews conducted with facility confirmed this information. ODO also found that indigent detainees are provided with replacement items but are charged for the items when their account balances have sufficient funds to cover the cost of the items (Deficiency PH-130).", "ACTIVITIES": "Although detainees are notified of telephone monitoring in the facility handbook and postings near the telephones, the facility does not have a written policy on monitoring detainee telephone calls (Deficiency TA-131). Additionally, staff interviews confirmed that the facility has not designated any staff member(s) to inspect the functionality of the telephones on a daily basis (Deficiency TA-232). Rather, detainees identify inoperable phones and staff, in turn, have them repaired or replaced. A staff member stated the phones are checked for contraband, but not to ensure operability or make random phone checks on the free call platform (Deficiency TA-333). ODO conducted operational checks of telephones in the housing units and found them in good working order. Finally, ICE/ERO does not maintain telephone serviceability sheets, as required by the standard (Deficiency TA-434).", "JUSTICE": "Through review of the local supplement and interviews with facility staff, ODO found that although the handbook informs each detainee of their responsibilities while detained at the facility, it does not notify them of the availability of Legal Orientation Programs. Additionally, all detainees are issued the SCDOC facility handbook and the ICE National Detainee Handbook during the admissions process either via a personal computerized tablet or a hard copy. However since each SCDOC facility handbook is printed in only English and Spanish, it does not explain to the detainees the procedures for requesting interpretive services for essential communication if they do not speak or understand English or Spanish (Deficiency DH-135). All employees who have contact with the detainees receive a copy of the facility handbook during new hire orientation; conversely, they do not receive a copy of the ICE National Detainee Handbook (Deficiency DH-236). However, the facility administrator addresses the contents of the handbooks in initial and annual staff training. ODO reviewed the facility handbook and determined the facility handbook does not provide detainees with the procedure for requesting additional time in the law library (beyond the 5 hours per week); requesting legal reference materials not maintained in the law library; the required access to computers, printers, and other supplies; and that Lexis/Nexis is being used at the facility and instructions for its use are available (Deficiency LL&LM -137).

ODO found the hold rooms in the receiving and discharge area were dirty. ODO also found tables in the dining area were not adequately cleaned and sanitized during and after the lunch meal on the first day of the inspection (Deficiency EH&S-15). ODO toured the medical department and observed that the ante-rooms of the negative pressure cells (four were in use) had dust and grime on lineal surfaces and trash overflowing from the garbage cans. ODO also found the medical department had no personal protective equipment and supplies, sharps containers, or bio-hazardous waste trash cans (Deficiency EH&S-26).", "SECURITY": "ODO reviewed 33 detainee detention files and found 10 Orders to Detain (Form I-203) were not signed by an ERO authorizing official or were missing from the detention file (Deficiency A&R-17). ODO’s review of eight detainee detention files for detainees who had been released, transferred or deported, found none contained an Order to Release (Form I-203) signed by an ERO authorizing official (Deficiency A&R-28). ODO reviewed 33 detainee detention files and found three detainees were admitted into the general population of the facility before completion of the classification process. Two detainees were classified the following day and one detainee was classified two days after placement in general population (Deficiency CCS-19). ODO observed a high custody detainee walk unescorted in the main corridor with both low and medium-low classification detainees (Deficiency CCS-311). ODO’s review of the detainee roster found one high custody detainee with a history of violence was housed in a low custody unit (Deficiency CCS-412). The SDC classification system does not ensure detainees are reassessed and/or reclassified at 90- to 120-day intervals. ODO’s review of 33 files found 15 instances in which reclassifications were missing or were completed outside the required timeframe (Deficiency CCS-513). ODO observed that although officers posted at the front entrance check the identification documents of every individual entering or leaving the facility, they did not consistently log ODO team members into the visitor log book or issue them a blue visitor passes or a color-coded equivalent (Deficiency FS&C-114). ODO observed that while some detainee personal property is placed in facility tamper-resistant bags, other personal property is stored in used boxes that are taped shut and are not tamper resistant. Also, detainee luggage is secured in the overflow property room but is not sealed in a tamper-resistant manner (Deficiency F&PP-115). ODO reviewed inventory audit records as well as the associated facility policy and determined SDC changed their inventory audit process for small and large valuables, as well as detainee baggage and non-valuable property, due to a recent CoreCivic corporate technical assist visit. The new procedure effectively logs the property coming and going from each of the aforementioned categories in a logbook; however, the new procedure does not provide an inventory audit with the date, time, or the name of the officers conducting the inventory (Deficiency F&PP-216). ODO reviewed six detainee detention files and found four files did not contain documentation that the facility provided instruction to the detainees on the facility’s SAAPI program or that the detainees participated in the instruction session (Deficiency SAAPI-117). ODO’s review of 25 detainee detention files and the SMU’s visitor log found that while daily medical rounds were completed, the facility medical officer did not consistently sign each detainee’s individual Special Management Housing Unit Record on a daily basis (Deficiency SMU-118). ODO reviewed each housing pod’s ERO sign-in log and compared entries against the posted staff-detainee communication visit schedules. ODO found frequent entries by DOs for short visits to the detainee housing units; however, entries in the log were routinely missing on the days and hours of scheduled visits (as noted in the posted staff-detainee communication visit schedule), and ODO was unable to determine the frequency of ERO supervisor visits to the agreements and granted privileges (Deficiency SDC-119).", "CARE": "ODO reviewed 40 detainee medical files and found four instances in which a detainee arrived with medication or significant mental health and/or physical health conditions that were not evaluated within two days of arrival (Deficiency MC-225). ODO’s review of medical files found SDC did not complete initial physical examinations on seven detainees within 14 days of arrival (Deficiency MC-326). ODO’s review of medical files for five detainees in custody for greater than 365 days found three did not have documentation that an annual physical examination was offered and either declined or completed (Deficiency MC-427). ODO’s review of medical files found annual dental health assessments were completed for detainees in continuous custody greater than 365 days; however, the review of 40 records found initial dental assessments were not documented. The CoreCivic corporate dentist informed ODO initial assessments were not conducted at SDC and ODO’s review of practicing privileges found the dentist had not signed documentation granting limited dental privileges for evaluation and/or treatment for mid-level practitioners (e.g. nurse practitioners or physicians assistants) (Deficiency MC-528). ODO reviewed the temperature log in the maintenance department for January through April 2019 and found the water heaters did not consistently maintain hot water temperatures between 100-120 degrees Fahrenheit (Deficiency PH-129). ODO reviewed the ICE National Detainee Handbook and the facility detainee handbook, toured the detainee housing units, and toured other common areas of the facility including the medical area. ODO determined neither the ICE National Detainee Handbook nor the facility detainee handbook inform detainees of the method to request a reasonable accommodation. ODO also found the facility has no postings informing detainees how to request a reasonable accommodation (Deficiency DIA&A-130).", "ACTIVITIES": "ODO reviewed telephone serviceability records and found that although repair tickets are generated when needed and repairs are made in a timely manner, telephone repair information is not logged and maintained by the Field Office (Deficiency TA-131).

However, the smoke detection system’s annual inspection expired on June 12, 2017. Although Integrated Fire Protection, Inc. had inspected the smoke detector on both February 6, 2017 and July 31, 2017, they were unable to re-set the main panel on both occasions in order to renew the annual inspection. Consequently, by the time of ODO’s review, SDC still had not passed an inspection by a licensed professional in accordance with the standard (Deficiency EH&S-1), and this issue was not resolved prior to the conclusion of ODO’s inspection.", "SECURITY": "During intake, detainees are required to change into clothing provided by the facility. ODO observed staff instruct a group of newly arriving individuals to change clothing in the open holding area, affording them no privacy (Deficiency A&R-1). SDC policy states detainees will shower prior to entering their assigned housing unit whenever possible. However, SDC staff members informed ODO that detainees are only given the opportunity to shower once they are transferred to the housing unit (Deficiency A&R-2) (R-1). ODO’s review of the SDC Orientation video found it provides the detainees with a good overview of the facility and is available in both English and Spanish. However, there was no documentation of ERO’s approval of SDC’s orientation procedures (Deficiency A&R-3)(R-2). ODO confirmed release procedures meet the requirements of the standard; however, there was no documentation to confirm ERO approval (Deficiency A&R-4). Despite numerous conversations with SDC staff who advised ODO they would provide documentation of ERO’s approval for orientation and release procedures, it was not provided prior to the completion of the inspection.", "CARE": "N/A", "ACTIVITIES": "ODO observed posted information related to free legal services, consulate lists, and OIG posters throughout the housing areas. ODO conducted operational checks of telephones in the housing units and called randomly selected pre-programmed numbers finding them in good working order. However, the phone check also found the facility telephone system does not have a 1-800 operating platform allowing detainees to make free calls to state and federal government offices (Deficiency TA-1). The facility’s telephone system has a recorded message that advises detainees that calls are subject to monitoring. However, ODO did not find notices at each monitored telephone stating the procedures to obtain an unmonitored phone call (Deficiency TA-2). Telephone calls are generally limited to 20 minutes and all telephones are accessible throughout the day. However, telephone access hours are not posted in the housing units (Deficiency TA-3).", "JUSTICE": "The Grievance System at SDC allows detainees the opportunity to submit informal oral and written grievances, formal grievances, medical grievances and emergency grievances. Detainees have the right to skip the informal process and proceed directly to the formal grievance stage. However, the results of informal grievances are not logged into the grievance log, and SDC personnel fail to file a copy of the grievances in the detainee’s file (Deficiency GS-1). A review of the SDC grievance policy found it allows the Grievance Officer (GO) to grant an extension of up to 15 days if more time is required to reach a resolution. However, the 15 days SDC allows for selected grievance responses is well beyond the 5 days the standard limits facilities to (Deficiency GS-2)(R-5). Grievances submitted by detainees are logged into the facility grievance log and assigned a tracking number by the GO. ODO selected 30 files to review for proper grievance compliance. Seven of the 30 files were missing copies of grievances filed by the detainee (Deficiency GS-3).", "CONCLUSION": "During this inspection, ODO reviewed the facility’s compliance with seventeen (17) standards and found the facility compliant with six (6) standards. ODO found twenty-six (26) deficiencies in the remaining eleven (11) standards, including nine (9) priority components and five (5) repeat deficiencies. Finally, ODO identified one instance where the facility initiated corrective action prior to completion of the inspection.

ODO also learned that the transmitter was not functioning properly in Unit One, D-pod, so detainees could not use their earphones to hear the audio portion (Deficiency AR-211). ODO found that upon conclusion of the video, housing unit officers did not conduct a question and answer session. During their interviews, the officers even confirmed that question and answer sessions do not routinely occur (Deficiency AR-312). After interviewing staff and ICE/ERO personnel, it was determined the orientation procedures were not approved in advance by the local ERO Field Office (Deficiency AR-413).

Fire evacuation plans in English and Spanish were strategically placed throughout the facility; however, areas of safe refuge were not identified (Deficiency EH&S-29). Corrective Action: Prior to the completion of the inspection, the areas of safe refuge were identified on the diagrams and the updated diagrams were posted throughout the facility (C-1).", "SECURITY": "While there was no commingling in the housing units, ODO observed low custody detainees were seated next to high custody and medium high custody detainees in the waiting areas of the health services unit, and commingling in the hallways and pill line (Deficiency CCS-110). ODO staff checked wristbands to confirm the security level of those seated next to each other, and facility staff immediately separated detainees according to custody levels. Corrective Action: The facility initiated corrective action during the inspection by providing documentation indicating the hours for medical encounters were being extended, and additional space would be available to allow staff to separate detainees depending on security level to prevent commingling in the health services unit (C-2). Classification levels must be reviewed every 60 to 90 days following initial classification and every 90 to 120 days thereafter. A review of a representative sample of 40 detainee files found in one case, the reclassification assessment was completed, although after the time required by the standards. Specifically, 168 days elapsed between initial and reclassification assessments (Deficiency CCS-211). GPS assumed responsibility for classification duties on December 1, 2015 and immediately reviewed all detainees overdue, at that time, for a reclassification. Corrective Action: Prior to completion of the inspection, a reclassification assessment was conducted on the detainee who was overdue for a reclassification assessment (C-3). The kitchen has a vegetable and meat preparation room where knives are used by staff. Observation confirmed knives were tethered when in use, accounted for and secured by staff. Detainees use the room to wash fruits and vegetables. The door to this room is equipped with a “snap” lock, which can only be un-secured and opened from the outside once the locking mechanism engages the door frame (Deficiency K&LC-112). This type of lock presents a safety concern because staff or detainees entering the room are locked in with no means of egress in the event of an emergency. Corrective Action: Prior to completion of the inspection the facility ordered an approved locking device (mortise) to replace the snap lock. The approved locking device was installed on March 21, 2016 (C-4). The policy addresses the majority of the elements required by the standard, to include the facility’s zero tolerance policy for all forms of sexual abuse or assault. It also provides procedures for disciplining sexual conduct between detainees and staff, volunteers, or contract personnel but it does not notify individuals that the consequences of violating the agency’s sexual abuse policies can include termination (Deficiency SAAPI-113). Corrective Action: The facility initiated corrective action during the inspection by updating the policy on SAAPI and adding language to reflect that violation of agency sexual abuse policies can include termination (C-5). The policy indicates that the Field Office Director shall ensure the facility outlines the medical staff’s responsibility to report allegations or suspicions of sexual assault to facility staff, but the policy does not actually outline the responsibilities (Deficiency SAAPI-214). Corrective Action: The facility initiated corrective action during the inspection by updating the policy on SAAPI and adding language which outlines the medical staff’s responsibility to report allegations or suspicions of sexual assault to facility staff (C-6). The PREA Coordinator was able to explain the internal administrative investigative process, but the policy did not address procedures for coordinating internal administrative investigations with the assigned criminal investigative entity to ensure non-interference with criminal investigations (Deficiency SAAPI-315). Corrective Action: The facility initiated corrective action during the inspection by updating the policy on SAAPI and adding language to identify procedures for coordination of internal administrative investigations with the assigned criminal investigative entity to ensure non-interference with criminal investigations (C-7). ODO’s review of the detainee handbook found it provides the required information on reporting sexual abuse or sexual assault, but during the detainee interviews, one detainee from Senegal, was identified as speaking Wolof and another detainee, Hungarian. The detainees alleged they were unable to fully understand English or Spanish, in which the orientation video, notifications and facility handbooks are provided. The interviews with the detainees and ERO staff revealed the information was not provided in a language or manner the detainees’ understood (Deficiency SAAPI-416). Other deficiencies related to information not being provided in a language or manner the detainees’ understand are reported under Staff-Detainee Communication (page 9) and Detainee Handbook (page 11). Corrective Action: The facility initiated corrective action during the inspection by having translators, who speak Wolof and Hungarian, interpret the orientation video, ICE National Detainee Handbook, facility handbook and notifications located throughout the facility. ERO notified ODO that to prevent reoccurrence, when a detainee whose native language is not English but claims to understand the information in English, they will have the detainee handwrite on the checklist that they do not need a translator (C-8). ERO staff conducts weekly scheduled and unscheduled visits at facility. The days and times for scheduled visits are posted in all housing units. A review of the facility handbook reveals it contains the required information – including but not limited to the procedures to submit written questions, requests, or concerns to ERO staff, as well as the availability of assistance to prepare such requests, but it is not provided to all detainees in a language or manner they understand (Deficiency SDC-117). Corrective Action: The facility initiated corrective action during the inspection by having translators interpret the ICE National Detainee Handbook and facility handbook for two detainees that do not fully understand English or Spanish. ERO notified ODO that to prevent reoccurrence, when a detainee whose native language is not English but claims to understand the information in English, they will have the detainee handwrite on the checklist that they do not need a translator (C-9).", "CARE": "Religious Diet Authorization forms identifying detainees approved for religious diets are generated by the chaplain and issued to the food service department. Detainees are issued special diet identification cards; however, the cards do not include the food service administrator’s (FSA) signature or the diet expiration date (Deficiency FS-118). ODO’s inspection of sack meals for detainees being transported between scheduled meals found they did not include a fruit and a dessert item (Deficiency FS-219). Corrective Action: ODO observed a fruit and dessert item being added to sack meals prior to the completion of the inspection (C-10). ODO’s review of purchasing procedures for potentially dangerous items such as knives, nutmeg, and yeast revealed the policy does not include provisions for special handling (Deficiency FS-320). ODO noted the electronic system used for processing purchase requests does not allow the FSA to input special handling instructions. An interview with facility staff revealed the temperature gauge for the final rinse compartment of the dish machine became inoperable on March 8, 2016; therefore, water temperature readings were not being recorded correctly. Specifically, ODO’s review of temperature logs found staff was recording water temperatures for the pre-wash phase and not the final rinse phase (Deficiency FS-421). Corrective Action: Prior to the completion of the inspection, the facility replaced the temperature sensor in the final rinse compartment and started recording the water temperature readings in accordance with the standard (C-11).", "ACTIVITIES": "ODO observed postings in each detainee housing unit to include, telephone rules, a list of free legal services, pro bono lists, consulates lists, and OIG posters. However, ODO did not see telephone access hours posted near telephones (Deficiency TA-122). Corrective Action: Prior to the completion of the inspection, telephone access hours were posted near the telephones in the housing units (C-12).", "JUSTICE": "The facility provides detainees a copy of the ICE National Detainee Handbook and facility handbook upon admission to the facility. ODO reviewed a representative sample of 40 randomly selected detainee files and found all had receipts for both handbooks. However, after interviewing detainees and staff ODO determined that English handbooks were given to detainees with little to no proficiency in English or Spanish, and the facility administrator did not provide timely translation and interpretation services to the detainees covering all basic aspects of the handbooks (Deficiency DH-123). Corrective Action: The facility initiated corrective action during the inspection by having translators interpret the ICE National Detainee Handbook and facility handbook for two detainees that do not fully understand English or Spanish.

ODO reviewed 26 detainee files and found criminal history and classification documents are available at intake and that detainee files typically include the Record of Deportable/Inadmissible Alien (Form I-213). However, of the 26 files reviewed, 4 were missing the Form I-213, 3 were missing ERO signatures on the Form I-213, and 1 had a Form I-213 that was addressed to another facility (Deficiency A&R-210). ODO observed the facility’s orientation video and confirmed WCC does not have a facility-specific video (Deficiency A&R-311). ODO reviewed 26 detainee files and found that detainees signed and acknowledged orientation video forms prior to watching the video. ODO cites this practice as an Area of Concern. ODO reviewed six detainee files for detainees who had been released and found that four did not have an Order to Release (Form I-203a) (Deficiency A&R-412). ODO’s interview with the WCC business manager confirmed funds for detainees released after hours were left unsecured in the control center. The clear, sealed bag with detainee funds were placed on the counter in the control center, and no documentation was maintained reflecting placement of the funds into or out of the control center. ODO cites this as an Area of Concern. After interviewing the ERO Supervisory Detention and Deportation Officer, ODO confirmed that, upon release, detainees or their family are required to pay for transportation to local bus stations, and detainees are not given a list of legal, medical, social, or shelter services (Deficiency A&R-513). ODO observed that showers are not available in the processing areas for incoming detainees. Providing detainees, the opportunity to shower prior to entering their respective housing units facilitates high standards of personal hygiene and helps prevent the spread of communicable diseases and other unhealthy conditions within housing units. ODO cites the absence of showers in processing areas as an Area of Concern. ODO’s review of detainee detention files and interviews with the laundry supervisor and property room supervisor, confirmed the facility does not document issuance of clothing, bedding, or hygiene items to verify proper issuance. ODO cites this as an Area of Concern.", "CARE": "Meals for one housing unit with detainees classified as medium-high and high, as well as for detainees in segregation, are prepared in the food service kitchen, placed into metal serving pans, and transported to the housing unit in a closed metal warmer for satellite feeding. Staff then set up a heated serving line and place meals in open plastic trays rather than on thermal compartment trays, as required by the standard (Deficiency FS-136). ODO observed all food service workers wearing hair restraints, beard guards, clean white uniforms, and rubber boots. However, safety shoes are not worn in the kitchen, which is a designated foot hazard area (Deficiency FS-237). ODO’s inspection found the interior door release mechanism in one cooler and one freezer were broken and did not allow someone to open the door from the inside (Deficiency FS-338). ODO’s inspection found no evidence of patient education posters or pamphlets to provide information to detainees, as required by the standard (Deficiency MC-139). ODO reviewed 40 medical charts and found the facility did not screen six detainees for tuberculosis within 12 hours of arrival at the facility (Deficiency MC-240). ODO reviewed 40 medical records and found no documentation that 14-day health assessments for four detainees were completed and that 11 health assessments were not completed within 14 days of arrival (Deficiency MC-341). One assessment was conducted 47 days late, one was 14 days late, and nine were between one and six days late. ODO reviewed 40 comprehensive health assessments and found that 10 were reviewed by Licensed Nurse Practitioners to assess priority of treatment, not by the clinical medical authority (CMA) (Deficiency MC-442). Corrective Action: Prior to completion of the inspection, the facility initiated corrective action by having the CMA delegating this responsibility to the advanced practice providers via a memorandum (C-5). ODO’s review of documentation found three out of five detainees with a mental health referral did not receive a mental health evaluation within 72 hours of arrival (Deficiency MC-543). Two were not seen at all and one was seen by a telepsychiatry provider six days after the referral. A review of 20 sick call requests and related documentation verified that the detainees were triaged by nursing staff within 24 hours of receipt. However, five out of 20 sick call requests were not stamped with the date and time of receipt, and the urgency of assessment and/or referral were not specifically documented in any of the 20 cases (Deficiency MC-644). Medication distribution is scheduled three times per day in the HSU. Detainees present their identification card to the nurse, who verifies the information with the Medication Administration Record (MAR), distributes the medication, observes the detainee swallow, and initials the MAR. ODO’s observation of medical distribution operations found it orderly, efficient, and confidential. However, ODO’s review of 15 hard copy MARs found incomplete documentation of medication doses, with each page showing an average of six dosage boxes left blank (Deficiency MC-745). ODO reviewed the facility’s refusal of treatment process and found it discouraged detainee receipt of medication. Specifically, medication administration records showed many detainees refused doses over a period of one to two months, and none of the (approximately 30) refusal forms reviewed included a detainee signature. ODO was advised by a registered nurse that if detainees do not approach pill line, it is considered a refusal, and rather than locate the detainee or provide the necessary patient education related to medical risks of refusal, the nurse and officer sign the refusal form without requesting signature from the detainee. This process results in numerous refusal forms for some detainees. Furthermore, detainees receive no patient education, nor is there provider notification, and/or determination of need for treatment changes as required by the standard (Deficiency MC-846). ODO reviewed 40 detainee medical records and found no documentation of dental screening for four detainees; additionally, 11 dental screenings were not completed within 14 days of arrival (Deficiency MC-947). Directly coinciding with the initial comprehensive health assessments cited previously, one dental screening was conducted 47 days late, one was 14 days late, and nine were between one and six days late. ODO reviewed 11 health records for detainees prescribed psychotropic medication and did not find a signed consent form for the medication and its side effects in any case (Deficiency MC-1048). ODO toured each housing unit and found that, at the time of the inspection, detainees were housed in housing units, each with . was equipped with two showers, two toilets, two wash basins, and one urinal. The number of detainees housed on each therefore, there was not a sufficient number of showers, toilets, and wash basins to meet the industry standards (Deficiency PH-149).", "ACTIVITIES": "ODO reviewed the facility’s religious procedures and found the chaplain managed and coordinated religious activities for detainees. However, facility staff did not document the religious preference, or lack thereof, of newly arriving detainees (Deficiency RP-151). The chaplain documented the religious preference only when notified by the detainee or another source of information. ODO observed postings in each housing unit and found staff did not consistently post telephone rates in all housing units (Deficiency TA-152). Corrective Action: Prior to completion of the inspection, the facility initiated corrective action by posting calling rates in each housing unit (C-6). ODO interviewed facility staff and found that housing unit officers did not ensure each phone had a dial tone by testing the equipment or demonstrate that an individual could make calls using the free call platform (Deficiency TA-253). Corrective Action: Prior to completion of the inspection, the facility initiated corrective action by creating personal identification numbers for staff members to make calls using the free call platform (C-7). ODO observed signage on or near all telephones that provided detainees notice of monitored calls. However, ODO did not find any postings on or near the telephones with procedures for obtaining an unmonitored legal call (Deficiency TA-354).", "JUSTICE": "ODO reviewed the facility grievance log and found the facility did not forward logged grievances alleging staff misconduct to ICE/ERO in a timely manner, with a copy going to the ICE OPR Joint Intake Center and/or local OPR office for appropriate action (Deficiency GS-155).", "CONCLUSION": "N/A"}], "location_latitude": 31.8389272, "location_longitude": -92.79029009999999, "location_address": "560 Gum Springs Road, Winnfield, LA 71483", "location_field_office": "New Orleans Field Office", "location_source": "csv_facilities", "name_similarity_score": 1.0, "matched_facility_name": "Winn Correctional Center", "generated_summary": "A January 2025 inspection found no violations, suggesting the facility is currently operating within standards.

ODO interviewed the chief of security, reviewed four calculated use of force files (CUOF) and six immediate use of force (IUOF) files, and found in one out of four CUOF files, the facility did not have the detainee evaluated by medical staff to assess if the detainee had any medical needs and/or provide medical care after the CUOF incident (Deficiency UOFR-98). Additionally, in one out of four CUOF files, ODO found the following deficiencies: • No preauthorization consultation between a supervisor and medical staff to determine if the detainee had any medical considerations requiring specific precautions (Deficiency UOFR-189); • The UOF team deployed pepper spray without first consulting with facility medical staff (Deficiency UOFR-5210). This is a priority component; • Medical staff did not review the detainee’s medical file for a disease or condition potentially worsened by an intermediate force weapon (Deficiency UOFR-5311); • No authorization in advance by the FA or designee for the CUOF (Deficiency UOFR-6612); and • No consultation between facility staff and medical staff prior to the CUOF incident, resulting in no review by medical staff of the detainee’s medical file for a disease or condition potentially worsened by an intermediate force weapon (Deficiency UOFR-6713). ODO reviewed the files and after-action reports of the four CUOF incidents and the six IUOF incidents and found in one out of four CUOF files and five out of six IUOF files, the after-action review team did not document note discrepancies on the audiovisual records. Specifically, the audiovisual recordings of these incidents did not include medical examinations of the detainees nor if there were any findings that resulted from those medical examinations (Deficiency UOFR-17014).", "CARE": "ODO reviewed the suicide watch logs for 6 detainees placed on suicide watch during the inspection period. ODO found in 1 out of 6 watch logs, 44 instances where medical staff documented monitoring of the detainees between 16- and 32-minute intervals. Additionally, in another 1 out of 6 watch logs, ODO found 27 instances of documented monitoring between 16- and 22-minute intervals, rather than monitoring and documenting every 15-minutes or more (Deficiency SSHSPI-3415). This is a repeat deficiency and a priority component.", "ACTIVITIES": "N/A", "JUSTICE": "ODO reviewed 25 appeals to the grievance appeals board (GAB) and found in 1 out of 25 appeals, a lapse of 7 days between the GAB receiving the appeal on March 11 and providing a decision on March 18, 2024 (Deficiency GS-6016). ODO reviewed eight appeals to the FA and found in three out of eight appeals, the FA issued decisions within 7 to 8 days (Deficiency GS-6817). ODO interviewed the compliance administrator and found the FA did not forward written decisions of grievance appeals to the FOD (Deficiency GS-6918). ODO interviewed the facility’s compliance administrator and ERO New Orleans and found the facility received two grievances alleging staff misconduct during the review period but did not send copies to ICE’s Joint Intake Center (Deficiency GS-9319). This is a priority component.", "CONCLUSION": "During this inspection, ODO assessed the facility’s compliance with 18 standards under PBNDS 2011 (Revised 2016) and found the facility in compliance with 14 of those standards. ODO found 13 deficiencies in the remaining 4 standards. Since CLIPC’s last rated compliance inspection in January 2024, the facility’s performance trended upward. CLIPC went from 9 deficient standards and 17 deficiencies in January 2024 to 4 deficient standards and 13 deficiencies during this follow-up compliance inspection. The deficiencies included three priority component deficiencies and one repeat deficiency for suicide watch logs. ODO received a completed UCAP for the facility’s last ODO inspection in January 2024, which likely resolved most of the previously cited deficiencies. However, the corrective action documented on the UCAP for the SSHSPI standard did not resolve the recurrence of this deficiency. ODO recommends ERO New Orleans continue to work with the facility to resolve the remaining deficiencies in accordance with contractual obligations."}, {"Detention Center": "Central Louisiana ICE Processing Center", "Inspection Type": "Unannounced Compliance Inspection", "URL": "https://www.ice.gov/doclib/foia/odo-compliance-inspections/centralLouisianaIPC_JenaLA_Jan9-11_2024.pdf", "Inspection Date": "January 9-11, 2024", "Field Office": "ERO New Orleans", "Announced vs Unannounced": "Unannounced", "Environmental Health and Safety": "N/A", "Admission and Release": 1, "Custody Classification": "N/A", "System Facility": "N/A", "Security and Control": "N/A", "Funds and Personal Property": 1, "Post Orders": "N/A", "Searches of Detainees": "N/A", "Use of Force and Restraints": "N/A", "Special Management Units": "N/A", "Staff-Detainee Communication": 1, "Sexual Abuse and Assault Prevention and Intervention": "N/A", "Food Service": "N/A", "Hunger Strikes": "N/A", "Medical Care": "N/A", "Personal Hygiene Significant": 2, "Self-Harm and Suicide Prevention and Intervention": 1, "Correspondence and Other Mail": "N/A", "Religious Practices": "N/A", "Telephone Access": 2, "Voluntary Work Program": 1, "Grievance System": 4, "Law Libraries and Legal Materials": "N/A", "Detention Files Detainee Transfers": 1, "Total Deficiencies": 14, "Interviews Conducted": 0, "Interview Attempts Failed": 0, "SAFETY": "N/A", "SECURITY": "N/A", "CARE": "N/A", "ACTIVITIES": "N/A", "JUSTICE": "N/A", "CONCLUSION": "N/A"}, {"Detention Center": "Central Louisiana ICE Processing Center", "Inspection Type": "Follow-Up Compliance Inspection", "URL": "https://www.ice.gov/doclib/foia/odo-compliance-inspections/2023-CentralLouisianaIPC-JenaLA-June.pdf", "Inspection Date": "June 27-29, 2023", "Field Office": "ERO New Orleans Field Office", "Announced vs Unannounced": "N/A", "Environmental Health and Safety": "N/A", "Admission and Release": "N/A", "Custody Classification": "N/A", "System Facility": "N/A", "Security and Control": "N/A", "Funds and Personal Property": "N/A", "Post Orders": "N/A", "Searches of Detainees": "N/A", "Use of Force and Restraints": "N/A", "Special Management Units": "N/A", "Staff-Detainee Communication": 1, "Sexual Abuse and Assault Prevention and Intervention": "N/A", "Food Service": "N/A", "Hunger Strikes": "N/A", "Medical Care": "N/A", "Personal Hygiene Significant": "N/A", "Self-Harm and Suicide Prevention and Intervention": "N/A", "Correspondence and Other Mail": "N/A", "Religious Practices": "N/A", "Telephone Access": "N/A", "Voluntary Work Program": "N/A", "Grievance System": "N/A", "Law Libraries and Legal Materials": "N/A", "Detention Files Detainee Transfers": "N/A", "Total Deficiencies": 1, "Interviews Conducted": 15, "Interview Attempts Failed": 0, "SAFETY": "N/A", "SECURITY": "ODO reviewed CLIPC’s detainee request logbook and found no section for CLIPC to record the nationality of the detainee submitting a request to ERO New Orleans (Deficiency SDC-206).

In the food service area, the bleach inventory documented seven gallons of bleach, though there were only three gallons on hand. Likewise, the inventory form for the degreaser documented four gallons, and there were only three and one-half gallons on hand (Deficiency EH&S-16). ODO reviewed the facility-provided documentation for the inspection of the fire suppression system and interviewed senior facility staff and found the kitchen fire suppression system is not inspected quarterly (Deficiency EH&S-27). National Fire Protection Association (NFPA) code 72 requires quarterly testing of the fire alarm system. The system was last inspected on January 29, 2018, by Louisiana Special Systems, Opelousas, LA with no noted concerns.", "SECURITY": "Based on staff interviews and a review of facility practices, ODO determined detainees are not afforded privacy during the admission process. Instead, while nude, all detainees are viewed by officers of the same gender as the detainee, during the uniform exchange process. ODO determined this occurs in all cases, absent reasonable suspicion. ODO notes the facility only held male detainees at the time of inspection. While ODO understands the Warden issued a change order to APPSC Policy Section 506: Clothing Exchange which states detainees are not to be observed changing their clothes, ODO found all staff were not aware of this change. Also, while staff indicated they placed an order for materials to construct a space where detainees can change without being viewed by staff, ODO has received no information since the inspection this private area has been constructed (Deficiency A&R–18). ODO conducted interviews of admissions staff and viewed the detainee orientation video shown to detainees during the facility admissions process. ODO found the video was thorough and contained all required elements; however, ODO found APPSC’s orientation procedures were not approved by the local ERO field office (Deficiency A&R–29). Note: During the inspection, the ERO field office attempted to initiate Corrective Action for Deficiency A&R-2 by issuing a memorandum confirming orientation procedures have been reviewed and approved. However, because all staff had not been informed/trained of the change to APPSC Policy Section 506: Clothing Exchange and because the private area had not been constructed, ODO believes the Field Office’s approval of the facility’s orientation procedures is premature. ODO reviewed the facility-provided release procedures and interviewed senior facility staff, finding that release procedures were not approved by the local ERO field office (Deficiency A&R–310). Corrective Action: During the inspection, the field office issued a memorandum confirming the release procedures have been reviewed and approved (C-2).", "CARE": "ODO reviewed all policies provided by the facility and found the facility has not developed a policy for Disability Identification, Assessment, and Accommodation (Deficiency DIA&A-1 19). Note: It appears ERO is not assessing compliance in this area during its annual inspections, as three ERO inspections of this facility have taken place since the 2016 contract modification was signed, and this issue was not cited in any of those inspections. In addition to APPSC coming into compliance with this standard, ODO also recommends ERO re-assess its annual inspections regimen to ensure the Disability Standard is being properly assessed. ODO reviewed the ICE National Detainee Handbook, dated April 2016, and the facility’s detainee handbook. Neither handbook provides information to detainees on how to request a reasonable accommodation (Deficiency DIA&A-2 20). ODO reviewed the documentation provided by the facility’s FSM and confirmed the food service staff and inmate workers were medically cleared. Documentation was available verifying that the FSM is ServSafe® certified21. However, during shifts where the FSM is absent, food service department is not staffed with trained and qualified food service staff (Deficiency FS-122). ODO reviewed the facility’s medication policy and determined the policy does not address providing detainees who are transferred to another facility or released medication for continuity of care (Deficiency MC-123). While reviewing detainee housing areas ODO found the facility does not provide disposable razors to detainees on a daily basis. Instead, razors are issued to detainees on Monday, Wednesday, and Friday (Deficiency PH-1 24 ). ODO reviewed facility provided documentation and interviewed senior facility staff and found APPSC’s suicide prevention and intervention policy does not include a multidisciplinary suicide prevention committee (Deficiency SSH&SPI-1 25 ). APPSC’s suicide prevention and intervention policy does not state only a mental health professional, clinical medical authority, or designee may terminate a suicide watch after a current suicide risk assessment is completed (Deficiency SSH&SPI-2 26). Corrective Action: During the inspection, the facility updated their suicide prevention and intervention policy to include this requirement (C-3).", "ACTIVITIES": "ODO toured the detainee housing unit and reviewed all bulletin board postings in the housing unit. Additionally, ODO reviewed the ICE National Detainee Handbook, dated April 2016, and the facility’s detainee handbook local supplement. Neither the bulletin board nor the handbooks provided the procedure for a detainee to request an unmonitored phone call (Deficiency TA-1 27).", "JUSTICE": "APPSC provides all detainees a copy of the local handbook supplement in English or Spanish; however, the local supplement does not inform detainees of the rules pertaining to legal rights, group presentations and the availability of legal orientation programs (Deficiency DH-128). Corrective Action: During the inspection, the facility added this information to the local supplement of the detainee handbook (C-4). ODO reviewed the facility’s detainee handbook and determined the handbook does not provide a procedure for ICE detainees to contact ERO to appeal a grievance decision (Deficiency GS-129). The local detainee handbook supplement provides the address for contacting the Department of Homeland Security Office of the Inspector General; however, the zip code was found to be incorrect (Deficiency GS-230). The correct address is found in the ICE National Detainee Handbook. ODO reviewed the facility’s written procedures regarding the detainee grievance system. ODO determined the written procedures do not address urgent access to legal counsel and the law library (Deficiency GS-331). The grievance system at APPSC allows detainees the opportunity to submit informal oral grievances, formal grievances, medical grievances and emergency grievances; however, facility policy and the local supplement place time limits on when a detainee may submit a formal grievance (Deficiency GS-432). ODO reviewed the grievance logs for the last 12 months and found no grievances filed by ICE detainees. APPSC policy requires the grievance officer review prepared responses, intended for dissemination to detainees, in five working days. However, the standard requires the facility to deliver responses to detainees within five calendar days of receipt of the grievance. ODO recommends the facility adjust its policy to align with the standard. ODO reviewed the format of the ICE detainee grievance log and found grievances which do not contain the date of the appeal or the name of the grievance officer who conducted the initial review (Deficiency GS-633). Following an appellate review, the grievance log does not contain the date the appeal was received or the basis of the Grievance Appeal Board decision (Deficiency GS-734).

The lack of hazardous substance inventory records led ODO to find the following related deficiencies: • The facility did not maintain separate inventory records for each hazardous substance (Deficiency EHS-409); • The facility made no entries for each hazardous substance logged on a separate card (or equivalent) and filed alphabetically by substance (Deficiency EHS-4110); and • The facility did not maintain current inventory records for hazardous substances before, during, and after each use (Deficiency EHS-5311).", "SECURITY": "N/A", "CARE": "ODO reviewed 25 detainee medical records and found in 1 out of 25 records, the facility medical staff completed the health assessment of 1 detainee 16 days after the detainee arrived at the facility (Deficiency MC-13015).", "ACTIVITIES": "ODO interviewed the facility recreational specialist and facility administrator, reviewed the facility recreation schedule, and found the facility did not provide outdoor recreation to detainees", "JUSTICE": "N/A", "CONCLUSION": "N/A"}, {"Detention Center": "Jackson Parish Correctional Center", "Inspection Type": "Compliance Inspection", "URL": "http://www.ice.gov/doclib/foia/odo-compliance-inspections/2021-JacksonParishCC-JonesboroLA-October.pdf", "Inspection Date": "October 18-22, 2021", "Field Office": "ERO New Orleans Field Office", "Announced vs Unannounced": "N/A", "Environmental Health and Safety": 2, "Admission and Release": 1, "Custody Classification": "N/A", "System Facility": "N/A", "Security and Control": "N/A", "Funds and Personal Property": 1, "Post Orders": "N/A", "Searches of Detainees": "N/A", "Use of Force and Restraints": "N/A", "Special Management Units": 2, "Staff-Detainee Communication": "N/A", "Sexual Abuse and Assault Prevention and Intervention": "N/A", "Food Service": 2, "Hunger Strikes": "N/A", "Medical Care": 1, "Personal Hygiene Significant": 1, "Self-Harm and Suicide Prevention and Intervention": "N/A", "Correspondence and Other Mail": 2, "Religious Practices": "N/A", "Telephone Access": "N/A", "Voluntary Work Program": "N/A", "Grievance System": "N/A", "Law Libraries and Legal Materials": "N/A", "Detention Files Detainee Transfers": "N/A", "Total Deficiencies": 12, "Interviews Conducted": 12, "Interview Attempts Failed": 0, "SAFETY": "ODO reviewed diagrams of the facility’s housing units, photographs of the bathroom areas in the housing units, and written documentation.

The SDDO explained that all detainees housed at ECDF are classified by ERO Newark before assignment to ECDF, and ERO Newark utilized professional experience and individual analysis to determine if the three detainee charges were 'violent' as stated in the standard. He stated ERO Newark’s custody classification process involved a detailed examination of the detainee arrest records to determine if the domestic violence charge included physical violence or verbal altercation, the severity of the charge, officer accounts, gang affiliation, and a history or pattern of violence. Subsequently, ERO Newark determined the three detainees did not have a violent charge because they had no history of violence and were not gang affiliated, had only one charge of domestic violence that did not include a conviction, physical violence, or violent pattern, and therefore issued a medium-low classification.

Corrective Action: Prior to the completion of the inspection, the facility updated the policy on fire drills to include documenting the times keys are drawn and the times they arrive at the emergency exit doors (C-1). The facility has prominently posted evacuation diagrams in English and Spanish, which include locations of emergency equipment and directional arrows for traffic flow. ODO observed areas of safe refuge are not identified on the diagrams (Deficiency EH&S-29).

Facility staff prints the detainees’ names on the top and bottom portion of I-77 forms, but reviews of the present forms revealed detainees have not signed either section (Deficiency F&PP-211). SEXUAL ABUSE AND ASSAULT PREVENTION AND INTERVENTION (SAAPI) During a tour of the facility, ODO observed both ICE SAAPI and DHS Office of Inspector General (OIG) hotline postings in the detainee housing areas and the intake area, but there was no SAAPI posting in the Special Management Unit (SMU) (Deficiency SAAPI-112). Corrective Action: Prior to the completion of the inspection the facility placed SAAPI postings in the SMU (C-3). ODO’s review of the detainee handbook found it provides the required information on reporting allegations of sexual abuse or sexual assault. The facility uses a log to record the times the orientation video is presented, but does not maintain documentation of detainee participation in the instruction session (Deficiency SAAPI-213). An interview with facility staff and review of documentation, in reference to a previous allegation of an incident of sexual abuse revealed the facility separated the detainees involved and moved both to medical services for an evaluation. Facility staff notified ODO, the detainee alleged as the perpetrator was later moved to another dorm, and the alleged victim was moved back to general population without being re-classified (Deficiency SAAPI-314). SPECIAL MANAGEMENT UNITS (SMU) ODO’s review of facility policy confirmed detainees in segregation are to have access to all required services and privileges. Consistent with the standard, the policy also requires medical staff to make daily rounds in the SMU. However, ODO’s review of the SMU Confinement Sign- In Log and Confinement Activity Records found daily visits by medical personnel are not consistently documented, which prevented ODO from determining if health care personnel are conducting daily assessments (Deficiency SMU-115). The facility is required to comply with optimum levels of the PBNDS 2011 in regards to recreation privileges for detainees on segregation. Detainees on administrative segregation must be offered at least two hours of recreation, seven days a week; and detainees on disciplinary segregation must be offered at least one hour of recreation, seven days a week. ODO’s review of the Confinement Activity Records and the unit log found entries do not support that these requirements are met (Deficiency SMU-216). The duration of recreation periods were not recorded; and officers did not consistently make entries reflecting when recreation was offered and refused. STAFF-DETAINEE COMMUNICATION (SDC) A review of the policy revealed the facility does not have written procedures to promptly route and deliver detainee requests to the appropriate ICE/ERO officials by authorized personnel without reading, altering, or delaying such requests (Deficiency SDC-117). In addition, the facility does not have a standard operating procedure that addresses detainees with special requirements who may need assistance from another detainee, housing unit officers, or other facility staff members in preparing a request form (Deficiency SDC-218). During a tour of the facility, ODO observed the days and times for scheduled visits by ICE/ERO staff posted in all housing units, except the Special Management Units (Deficiency SDC-319).

ODO reviewed RCC Environmental Hazard Emergency Plan, interviewed the RCC chief of security, and found the plan did not prohibit detainees from taking personal property, except for prescribed medicine, into safe harbor areas (Deficiency EP-16513). ODO reviewed RCC’s Evacuation Emergency Plan, interviewed the RCC chief of security and found the plan did not factor in all variables and combinations of variables that may precipitate or affect a mass evacuation, such as the following contingencies and their repercussions: • Minimal warning/preparation time; • Weather-related complications (e.g., tornadoes, hurricanes, blizzards); • An area-wide disaster that would limit facility access to state and local emergency services (e.g., police, fire department, hospitals, military, etc.) and transportation providers; and • Failure of at least 10 percent of staff to respond when recalled (Deficiency EP-17014). ODO reviewed RCC's Evacuation Emergency Plan, interviewed the RCC chief of security and found the plan did not include how to: • Identify and prepare a list of suppliers to provide essential goods and materials during the emergency; • Prepare an alternative list, identifying product substitutions and alternate suppliers; and • Assign priorities among the essentials listed, recognizing shortages likely to occur during an area-wide emergency (Deficiency EP-17115). ODO reviewed RCC's Evacuation Emergency Plan, interviewed the RCC chief of security, and found the facility did not have signed contracts, agreements, and/or commitments for transportation and supplies as needed if federal and other public-sector resources are unavailable (Deficiency EP-17216).", "SECURITY": "ODO reviewed the training records for RCC staff assigned to admissions duties, interviewed the intake lieutenant and compliance coordinator, and found staff assigned to admission duties did not complete RCC admission process training (Deficiency AR-1025). ODO reviewed Lasalle Corrections’ Admission and Release procedures and policy, detainee detention files, and interviewed the RCC intake lieutenant, and found missing, incomplete or inaccurate Order to Detain or Order to Release forms (Forms I-203), in out of detainee detention files reviewed. Specifically, five files were missing a Form I-203 and one file contained a Form I-203 with no authorizing signatur (Deficiency AR-5426). ODO interviewed the RCC chief of security and found RCC did not maintain certification documentation for an intermediate force device that the facility authorized the staff to use (Deficiency UOFR-3241).", "CARE": "ODO interviewed the RCC kitchen supervisor and found she had no food service management experience prior to her assignment as kitchen supervisor (Deficiency FS-142). ODO interviewed the RCC kitchen supervisor, inspected the detainee housing units, and observed staff did not prevent detainees from leaving the food service department with food items. Specifically, ODO observed several Styrofoam trays in the housing units with meals removed from the kitchen by detainee kitchen workers without permission from staff (Deficiency FS-4443). ODO interviewed the RCC kitchen supervisor, reviewed detainee job descriptions, and found the facility’s kitchen supervisor did not review detainee job descriptions on an annual basis (Deficiency FS-5344). ODO observed staff thawing potentially hazardous food in an improper manner. Specifically, staff placed tubes of ground chicken in running hot water instead of submerged in running water at a temperature of 70 degrees F or below (Deficiency FS-14945). ODO observed staff obtaining food temperatures prior to placement on the serving line and all temperatures met the requirements of the standard when served and transported from the kitchen; however, ODO observed detainees placing their meal trays in their bunk drawers, which are not temperature controlled, to eat later (Deficiency FS-26046). ODO reviewed detainee records and found the RCC medical staff pre-screened and approved records for work details in the kitchen; however, the medical staff did not provide ODO with any documentation verifying food service personnel had received pre-employment medical examinations prior to placement in the kitchen (Deficiency FS-30647). ODO inspected the detainee restroom in the kitchen area and found the facility did not maintain the toilet to appropriate sanitation levels. Specifically, the toilet was not clean and had excessive unsanitary buildup on it (Deficiency FS-38048). ODO interviewed the RCC director of nursing and the HSA and found the facility lacked accreditation with the National Commission on Correctional Health Care (NCCHC) (Deficiency MC-1049). ODO notes NCCHC scheduled the facility for an NCCHC evaluation to occur in January 2022. ODO observed RCC provided toilets 24 hours per day that could be used without staff assistance when detainees are confined to their cells or sleeping areas; however, the population counts in multiple housing units did not comply with ACA Expected Practice 4-ALDF-4B-08, requiring toilets be provided at a minimum ratio of 1 for every 12 male detainees with urinals substituted for up to one-half of the toilets (Deficiency PH-3250). ODO observed RCC provided washbasins with temperature controlled hot and cold running water 24 hours per day; however, the population counts in multiple housing units did not comply with ACA Expected Practice 4-ALDF-4B-08, requiring a minimum ratio of 1 washbasin for every 12 detainees (Deficiency PH-3751). ODO observed the facility’s detainee housing unit showers are thermostatically controlled to temperatures between 100-120 degrees F; however, the population counts in multiple housing units did not comply with ACA Expected Practice 4-ALDF-4B-09, requiring a minimum ratio of 1 shower for every 12 detainees (Deficiency PH-3952).", "ACTIVITIES": "ODO reviewed the RCC detainee handbook and found it did not contain a notification to detainees informing them that the facility and ICE/ERO considers possession of identity documents as contraband and ICE/ERO may use this as evidence against them or for other purposes authorized by law (Deficiency COM-2253). ODO reviewed detainee detention files for detainee volunteer workers and found detainee was working in the kitchen and did not have a voluntary work program agreement for the kitchen (Deficiency VWP-6454).", "JUSTICE": "N/A", "CONCLUSION": "During this inspection, ODO assessed the facility’s compliance with 23 standards under PBNDS 2011 (Revised 2016) and found the facility in compliance with 11 of those standards. ODO found 55 deficiencies in the remaining 12 standards. ODO commends RCC staff for its responsiveness during this inspection. ODO recommends ERO New Orleans work with RCC to resolve any deficiencies that remain outstanding in accordance with contractual obligations.

The facility went from 7 deficient standards and 17 deficiencies in November 2022 to 1 deficient standard and 1 deficiency during this most recent inspection. The facility’s improved performance and no repeat deficiencies were likely the result of ERO El Paso staff and a DSM providing daily oversight of the facility and from completing a uniform corrective action plan for ODO’s last inspection of OCPC in November 2022. ODO recommends ERO El Paso continue working with the facility to resolve the remaining deficiency in accordance with 6 “Each facility’s health care provider shall conduct a comprehensive health assessment, including a physical examination and mental health screening, on each detainee within 14 days of the detainee’s arrival unless more immediate attention is required due to an acute or identifiable chronic condition.” See ICE PBNDS 2011 (Revised 2016), Standard, Medical Care, Section (V)(M)."}, {"Detention Center": "Otero County Processing Center", "Inspection Type": "Unannounced Compliance Inspection", "URL": "https://www.ice.gov/doclib/foia/odo-compliance-inspections/oteroCoProcCntrChaparralNM_Nov1-3_2022.pdf", "Inspection Date": "November 1-3, 2022", "Field Office": "ERO El Paso", "Announced vs Unannounced": "Unannounced", "Environmental Health and Safety": "N/A", "Admission and Release": "N/A", "Custody Classification": 1, "System Facility": "N/A", "Security and Control": "N/A", "Funds and Personal Property": "N/A", "Post Orders": "N/A", "Searches of Detainees": "N/A", "Use of Force and Restraints": "N/A", "Special Management Units": "N/A", "Staff-Detainee Communication": "N/A", "Sexual Abuse and Assault Prevention and Intervention": "N/A", "Food Service": "N/A", "Hunger Strikes": "N/A", "Medical Care": "N/A", "Personal Hygiene Significant": "N/A", "Self-Harm and Suicide Prevention and Intervention": "N/A", "Correspondence and Other Mail": "N/A", "Religious Practices": "N/A", "Telephone Access": "N/A", "Voluntary Work Program": "N/A", "Grievance System": "N/A", "Law Libraries and Legal Materials": "N/A", "Detention Files Detainee Transfers": "N/A", "Total Deficiencies": 11, "Interviews Conducted": 0, "Interview Attempts Failed": 0, "SAFETY": "ODO reviewed the OCPC TBL program, inspected four fleet vehicles, interviewed facility staff, and found the following deficiencies:\n• The OCPC administrator has overall responsibility for all aspects of vehicle operations instead of the FOD (Deficiency TBL-158);\n• One out of four OCPC fleet vehicles did not have completely secured doors.

Corrective Action: The facility initiated corrective action during the inspection by making a change to the dormitory card. The dormitory card was changed to have a discrete place for detainees to sign for the National Detainee Handbook and a discrete place to sign for the local detainee handbook (C-1). ODO observed high custody detainees being co-mingled with low custody detainees during ODO’s detainee interview session, religious services, sick call hours, and while being escorted through the facility hallways (Deficiency CCS-1)10. ODO inspected 30 detainee files and confirmed the presence of signed receipts for both funds and valuables. Property inventory forms were present in each file. A review of the grievance log from one year preceding the date of ODO’s inspection found no grievances filed related to detainee property. However, during observation of the facility’s intake process, ODO found facility staff did not consistently search all arriving detainees’ personal property. ODO observed luggage and sealed bags grouped on the floor of the intake room which were not searched by intake staff (Deficiency F&PP-1)11. Facility intake staff does not consistently inventory all detainees’ personal property during admission, including property that was previously inventoried and sealed by another facility (Deficiency F&PP-2)12. ODO reviewed 25 employee training files and found the facility documents all required employee training including SAAPI; however, the facility does not consistently document SAAPI training for three contract medical staff or any volunteer staff (Deficiency SAAPI-1)13. ODO reviewed the facility’s SAAPI Policy, Number 2.1.18, dated December 7, 2015, and found the facility does not have written procedures for the transport of a detainee who may need closer observation for the detainee’s own safety (Deficiency SAAPI-2)14. ODO observed four detainees in administrative segregation during the inspection. Administrative orders were completed and issued to the detainees, and a supervisor documented review of the assignments to segregation, including interviews of the detainees. However, ODO interviewed the Chief of Security and found that copies of administrative segregation orders are not forwarded to the FOD or designee (Deficiency SMU-1)15. The Chief of Security stated ERO staff is notified of administrative segregation placements by telephone and by e-mail. The facility provides detainees one hour of recreation per day, seven days a week; however, under the PBNDS 2011 optimal level of compliance ,which the facility is contractually obligated to provide, the facility is required to provide detainees two hours of recreation per day, seven days a week while housed in administrative segregation (Deficiency SMU-2)16. OCPC has hand-held video cameras for use in recording calculated use of force incidents. Per post orders and policy, the video camera equipment is tested on each shift to verify operability. The OCPC log documented there was one use of force incident in the year preceding ODO’s inspection. The incident involved immediate use of force on a detainee who struck another detainee during intake. ODO reviewed written documentation of the incident, as well as video taken on a stationary security camera in the area; however, the facility administrator failed to send a copy of the audiovisual recording of this Use of Force incident to the FOD (Deficiency UoF&R-1)17. ERO did not review or approve the after action review procedure in the facility’s Use of Force and Restraints policy, and the procedure does not meet ERO’s model described in the standard (Deficiency UoF&R-2)18. The facility’s Use of Force Committee did not review the one Use of Force incident in the past year on the workday following the incident (Deficiency UoF&R-3)19.

ODO received a completed UCAP for the full- inspection in October 2023, which resolved most deficiencies previously cited; however, was insufficient to prevent reoccurrence of the deficiency in TA. ODO recommends ERO El Paso continue to work with the facility to resolve the deficiencies that remain in accordance with contractual obligations. ODO conducted this unannounced follow-up inspection earlier than originally scheduled due to detainee complaints regarding the facility’s plumbing and overall sanitary conditions. ODO spoke with facility staff and detainees, reviewed facility records and disciplinary reports for the two detainees who made the complaints, and observed the facility’s cleanliness and sanitary conditions. ODO determined the detainees’ complaints were unfounded and their disciplinary records showed they were at fault for flushing debris down their toilets, causing an overflow of toilet water (water only, no waste) onto the housing unit floor. The facility contracted a plumber to clear the toilets, which resolved the problem. ERO transferred both detainees out of TCDF to another facility and TCDF has had no plumbing problems since the detainees left. Additionally, ODO’s observance of the facility’s housing units found all housing units used to house detainees were clean and ODO noted no issues in the bathrooms nor showers other than the porcelain toilets and sinks mentioned in the Area of Concern above."}, {"Detention Center": "Torrance County Detention Facility", "Inspection Type": "Compliance Inspection", "URL": "https://www.ice.gov/doclib/foia/odo-compliance-inspections/torranceCoDetFac_EstanciaNM_Oct17-19_2023.pdf", "Inspection Date": "October 17-19, 2023", "Field Office": "ERO El Paso", "Announced vs Unannounced": "N/A", "Environmental Health and Safety": 1, "Admission and Release": "N/A", "Custody Classification": "N/A", "System Facility": "N/A", "Security and Control": "N/A", "Funds and Personal Property": "N/A", "Post Orders": "N/A", "Searches of Detainees": "N/A", "Use of Force and Restraints": "N/A", "Special Management Units": 0, "Staff-Detainee Communication": 1, "Sexual Abuse and Assault Prevention and Intervention": "N/A", "Food Service": "N/A", "Hunger Strikes": "N/A", "Medical Care": "N/A", "Personal Hygiene Significant": "N/A", "Self-Harm and Suicide Prevention and Intervention": 1, "Correspondence and Other Mail": "N/A", "Religious Practices": "N/A", "Telephone Access": 6, "Voluntary Work Program": "N/A", "Grievance System": "N/A", "Law Libraries and Legal Materials": "N/A", "Detention Files Detainee Transfers": "N/A", "Total Deficiencies": 9, "Interviews Conducted": 0, "Interview Attempts Failed": 0, "SAFETY": "ODO toured all detainee housing units and found soap scum in units 5, 6, 7, and 8; debris in 35 out of 70 showers; and broken or missing floor tiles in 11 out of 70 showers (Deficiency EHS-117).", "SECURITY": "ODO inspected 20 cells in the SMU and observed porcelain toilets and sinks.

SCRJ went from 11 deficient standards and 37 deficiencies in September 2022 to 5 deficient standards and 5 deficiencies during this most recent special review inspection, although all 5 deficiencies are repeat deficiencies for no hazardous materials training, no preemployment medical exams for FS personnel, no initial and annual training for HS, not completing a comprehensive health exam of a detainee within 14 days of arrival, and no annual training for suicide prevention and intervention. ODO has not received a completed uniform corrective action plan for the special review inspection in September 2022 which likely contributed to the repeat deficiencies identified in the EHS, FS, HS, MC, and SSHSPI standards.

ODO found 64 deficiencies in the remaining 8 standards. ODO found both administrative and operational deficiencies. The administrative deficiencies were mostly due to no updated facility policies to reflect NDS 2019 requirements, lack of all required staff training, and lack of current inventory for hazardous substances used at the facility. Ten of the deficiencies were priority component deficiencies. This was ODO’s first inspection of BCCC; therefore, ODO performed no trend analysis of this facility. Prior to this special review, the facility’s last known oversight inspection was an ERO Operational Review Self-Assessment (ORSA), which occurred on January 9, 2023.71 Per ERO’s ORSA policy guidelines, FODs are responsible for developing effective oversight relationships with facilities eligible to participate in the ORSA process. Given the number of deficient standards, total number of deficiencies, and the number of priority component deficiencies ODO identified during this special review, ODO recommends ERO New Orleans increase oversight to improve compliance and work with the facility to resolve deficiencies in accordance with contractual obligations."}], "location_latitude": 42.3166565, "location_longitude": -85.1757947, "location_address": "185 E.

ODO reviewed SCCJ’s UOF policy, staff training records, and found the facility did not ensure all detention staff received annual training in how to effectively handle situations involving aggressive detainees (Deficiency UOF-1). The facility’s UOF policy authorized and which were prohibited by the UOF standard (Deficiency UOF-2). SCCJ’s UOF policy and their UOF training curriculum did not address using confrontation avoidance procedures before a supervisor authorized a calculated UOF (Deficiency UOF-3).

ODO identified seven Areas of Concern at ACDF. Of particular concern is the lack of a formalized agreement between the facility and the local ICE/ERO Atlanta staff for transferring detainees, who require placement in AS or DS. As noted earlier this had the potential of leading to inappropriate segregation of detainees. Also, a formal agreement would alleviate some of the concerns ODO had with the facility not having a certified suicide watch cell.

in both the east and west buildings of the facility, and observed the bathrooms and showers in the general housing units in both buildings had soap and scum buildup, as well as mildew, and hard water stains on the shower floors, walls, and sinks (Deficiency EH&S-15). Barbering operations in the west building of the facility are conducted in the common area of the units. ODO observed the space is not a dedicated area for barbering operations and lacks both hot and cold running water for cleaning and disinfecting barbering instruments (Deficiency EH&S-26).", "SECURITY": "ODO reviewed the facility’s orientation video which is available in both English and Spanish and played on a continuous loop in the intake holding area. ODO identified as an Area of Concern that the video has no audio component. Detainees must sign an acknowledgement form that verifies that have seen the video, been given an opportunity to ask questions, and have received handbooks. During the inspection, ODO observed the video was not functioning and that many detainees were released from intake into the general population without viewing the orientation video (Deficiency A&R-17). ODO recommends the facility consider a back-up process to ensure all admitted detainees are shown the videos when the primary system is down, as well as provide audio to the site-specific video. ODO found the facility’s orientation procedures were not approved by the ERO Field Office (Deficiency A&R-28). • Corrective Action: Prior to the completion of the inspection, the ERO Field Office initiated corrective action by approving the facility’s orientation procedures (C-1). ODO also found the facility’s release procedures were not approved by the ERO Field Office (Deficiency A&R-39).", "CARE": "ODO observed the food service staff and the detainee workers in the west and east building kitchens wore clean clothes and practiced safe food handling procedures during food production and tray preparation, and that overall sanitation of the kitchen and storage areas was acceptable during both food production and tray preparation. However, ODO observed that detainees used the same cloth to wipe down the tables in the dining area and did not rinse the cloth between tables (Deficiency FS-116). ODO observed freezer, cooler and dish machine temperatures met the established industry standards during the inspection, with the exception of cooler number two in the facility’s east building kitchen, which did not maintain a proper cooling temperature (Deficiency FS-217). ODO used an infrared thermometer to take the temperature of the cooler once each day during the inspection and found that the temperature inside the cooler was consistently several degrees higher than the temperature as read by the thermometer in the cooler, and that the cooler did not maintain a consistent temperature, but ranged between 37 degrees Fahrenheit and 52 degrees Fahrenheit. • Partial Corrective Action: During the inspection, the facility replaced the faulty local thermometer in the cooler and ordered a replacement part to fix the temperature control issue. ODO inspected dry storage areas in the both the east and west buildings and found boxes stacked against the wall (Deficiency FS-318). • Corrective Action: Prior to the completion of the inspection, facility staff moved the boxes sufficiently away from the walls to facilitate pest control measures (C-3).", "ACTIVITIES": "ODO toured the detainee housing units and determined the current version of the pro-bono platform call list was not posted in the housing units of the facility (Deficiency TA-127). ODO reviewed the facility legal visitation log. A separate legal visitation log is maintained for both the buildings. However, the legal visitation logs do not consistently contain all required information. Specifically, log entries are routinely missing for whether the detainee currently has a G-28 (Notice of Entry of Appearance as Attorney or Accredited Representative) on file, and the time the legal visit ended. (Deficiency V-128).", "JUSTICE": "N/A", "CONCLUSION": "During this inspection, ODO reviewed the facility’s compliance with 21 of the standards in the ICE PBNDS 2011. ODO identified 24 deficiencies in 13 standards including two repeat deficiencies. ODO noted many deficiencies resulted from a lack of adequate documentation and proper audio recording; insufficient form use; absence of proper postings in housing units; and a lack of proper policy approval from ERO in its Admission and Release program. ODO has identified the latter issue as a systemic issue at many facilities and recommends ERO increase its communication with facility staff to review and approve all facility policies requiring ERO approval. As discussed in the Medical Care section of the report, ODO found the facility lacked documentation for two medical staff out of a total of medical files reviewed. Additionally, three of the five medical deficiencies resulted from a single case in which proper documentation and follow-up procedures were not done. Lastly, given the substantial number of detainees at AIPC who require mental health care, ODO finds that the current mental health staffing is inadequate to meet the demand. ODO also noted one Best Practice in the Medical Care standard: AIPC employs a full-time NP licensed by the State of California for the provision of Women’s Health Care. In certain areas of the facility, ODO observed poor sanitary conditions and hygienic practices. Specifically, the facility should work to maintain better sanitary conditions in the housing unit showers, floors, walls and sinks.

Security gaps included no written use-of-force review procedures, while medical care lapses left staff untrained to handle hunger strikes or suicide risks.

Additionally, ODO reviewed the facility’s Inmate/Detainee Classification policy and confirmed the policy did not include the requirement for training staff who perform the classification function (Deficiency CCS-16).\n\nODO reviewed 16 detainee files and interviewed the classification sergeant who confirmed not all reclassifications were reviewed by a supervisor (Deficiency CCS-27). Only five out of 16 files reviewed contained reclassification documentation. Furthermore, ODO reviewed the facility’s Inmate/Detainee Classification policy and verified the policy did not require supervisory review of all classifications.\n\nODO reviewed the facility’s Inmate/Detainee Classification and Clothing, Bedding, and Laundry Services policies, and the facility detainee handbook. Additionally, the ICE National Detainee Handbook, Amendment on Classification from the jail commander dated July 25, 2018, and photos of detainee clothing, were examined.

ODO reviewed the facility FS policy, interviewed the FSC, and found the facility did not implement written procedures nor maintain documentation for weekly inspections of all FS areas, including dining, storage, equipment, and food-preparation areas (Deficiency FS-11641). ODO reviewed the facility FS procedures and documentation, interviewed the FSC, and found from September 1, 2022, through August 31, 2023, the FS staff did not: • Document daily refrigerator and water temperature checks (Deficiency FS-11742); • Conduct temperature checks of the dishwasher for every meal nor for the walk-in refrigerator and freezer according to a site-specific schedule (Deficiency FS-11843); and • Record and file daily temperature checks to ensure accessibility (Deficiency FS-11944). ODO reviewed non-medical and medical staff training records and found in out of training records, no documented hunger strike training at orientation and annually thereafter nor any training curriculum for hunger strikes (Deficiency HS-145). ODO reviewed detainee medical records and found credentialed health care personnel did not perform duties within their scope of practice. Specifically, on August 8 and August 18, 2023, a licensed practical nurse (LPN) and a certified nurse aide (CNA) performed comprehensive health assessments, but the Idaho Nursing Act, dated May 21, 2020, and the Idaho Administrative Procedure Act, Rules 24.34.01 and 23.01.01.490, do not authorize LPNs and CNAs to conduct comprehensive health assessments (Deficiency MC-1146). This is a priority component. As a result of the LPN and CNA conducting the detainee assessments on August 8 and August 18, 2023, ODO identified the following related deficiencies: • Unauthorized medical staff conducted two detainee comprehensive health assessments (Deficiency MC-2847); • The facility provider did not review two detainee physical examinations by personnel other than the provider (Deficiency MC-2948); and • Unauthorized medical staff conducted two detainee initial dental screenings (Deficiency MC-4449). ODO reviewed detainee medical records and found in out of records, medical staff conducted intake screenings between 15 and 130 hours after arrival and no intake screening at all for 1 detainee (Deficiency MC-1250). This is a priority component. ODO reviewed detainee medical records and found in out of records, no documented information obtained by medical staff regarding any known acute, emergent, or pertinent past or chronic medical conditions. Specifically, the detainee arrived at the facility on November 29, 2022, and ODO found no documentation of an intake screening before the detainee’s transfer on November 30, 2022 (Deficiency MC-1351). This is a priority component. ODO reviewed detainee medical records and found in out of records, the facility had no documentation confirming detainees received tuberculin skin tests nor chest X-rays in addition to symptom screenings (Deficiency MC-1852). This is a priority component. ODO reviewed facility MC policy, interviewed medical staff, and found the written plans did not address: • The management of infectious and communicable diseases (Deficiency MC-2553).

ODO found the facility staff does not forward detainee passports from Mexico to ICE/ERO Dallas. Specifically, one out of 12 detainee passports were not given to ICE/ERO Dallas (Deficiency A&R-19). Corrective Action: Prior to completion of the inspection, the facility initiated corrective action and issued a memo on June 17, 2020, to staff indicating all identity documents would be inventoried, copied, and the original given to ICE/ERO Dallas (C-1). Twelve out of 12 detainee detention files did not include documentation the detainee acknowledged receipt of the ICE National Detainee Handbook and facility detainee handbook (Deficiency A&R-210). Three out of 12 released detainee files did not contain fingerprint documentation. ODO determined facility staff does not conduct fingerprinting during the detainee release process (Deficiency A&R-311). ODO reviewed the RPDC PowerPoint slide orientation video and observed the video does not include procedures for the detainee to contact the ERO deportation officer handling his/her case and how to use the telephone system to make telephone calls (Deficiency A&R-412). ODO noted an Area of Concern pertaining to the RPDC orientation PowerPoint presentation video. Facility staff confirmed the video was viewed by detainees inside the cell, the monitor was on a wall approximately 10 feet away in the processing open area. Utilizing the floor plan and ODO found the view from the farthest female cell was difficult to see the screen.", "CARE": "The Health Services Administrator (HSA) was unable to provide documentation of current arrangements with nearby medical facilities or health care providers to provide required health care not available within the facility (Deficiency MC-124) and the Clinical Medical Authority (CMA) was not the designated medical staff to determine the availability and placement of first aid kits (Deficiency MC-225). Corrective Action: Prior to completion of the inspection, the facility initiated corrective action and designated the CMA as the authority to determine first aid kits placement. (C-2). ODO reviewed medical staff files and found the following medical staff employee files did not have a valid professional licensure and/or certification for the jurisdiction in which they practiced and performed duties within the scope of their clinical license: CMA, contract dentist, Licensed Vocational Nurse , and telemedicine psychiatric Certified Nurse Practitioner (Deficiency MC-326). In all, 19 detainee medical files reviewed included tuberculosis (TB) screening with a purified protein derivative (PPD) test or current chest x-rays; however, one detainee’s PPD test was read past the 48-72 hours as per Center for Disease Control and Prevention guidelines (Deficiency MC-427). The facility medical staff did not obtain signed consent from two detainees, prior to administering psychotropic medications and did not document one detainee’s prescribed medication on the consent form (Deficiency MC-528). ODO cited entries and forms in the medical files reviewed, had illegible signatures with no printed name, nor title as an Area of Concern for authenticating documents. Entries in medical records, as a rule, need signed name, print or use a block stamp, and credentials. ODO also noted missing dates and times in some papers. Interview with the HSA revealed she was aware and working to educate medical staff.", "ACTIVITIES": "Religious Practices: One detainee stated he requested a bible written in French but did not receive it.

Specifically, ODO observed mold, mildew, and soap scum in showers; metal partitions in toilet areas were rusted and corroded; there were hard water stains on the partitions and in mop sinks; the mop sinks and sink/toilet combination fixtures were dirty; trash receptacles had significant food and beverage stains; and, metal doors, window and skylight frames were marked with graffiti and had peeling paint and rust. Corrective Action: Prior to the completion of the inspection, the detainee living units were thoroughly cleaned and sanitized (C-1). ODO reviewed the fire and safety inspection reports and found required monthly inspections were not conducted in February and March of 2016, and five weekly inspections were not conducted during the same period (Deficiency EH&S-2). ODO interviewed the facility safety manager who confirmed the inspections were not done and gave no further explanation for why the inspections had been missed.", "SECURITY": "ODO observed intake processing for 26 detainees and observed that all arriving detainees were pat-searched, but none were screened with a metal detector (Deficiency AR-1). Corrective Action: The facility initiated corrective action during the inspection by modifying post orders to require that officers use the metal detector in the intake area to search arriving detainees (C-2). ODO reviewed the detention files of 25 current and ten former detainees and found that two former detainees did not sign a form acknowledging receipt of the facility’s detainee handbook or the ICE National Detainee Handbook (Deficiency AR-2). ODO reviewed the electronic ICE detainee request log for the four months preceding ODO’s inspection and found each detainee request is logged; however, the electronic log does not contain all required elements from the standard. The electronic log only contains the detainee’s name, a-number, date sent, and date received (Deficiency SDC-1). Following review of the electronic log, ODO also reviewed the detention files of ten detainees who submitted requests to ICE. All ten files were missing copies of the completed detainee requests that were recorded in the electronic log (Deficiency SDC-2). ODO interviewed ERO and facility staff and determined copies of detainee requests are not consistently placed in the associated detention files. ODO reviewed the video and documentation for the four use of force incidents that occurred during the year preceding ODO’s inspection. ODO found the after-action review for one use of force incident was not completed until two weeks after the incident occurred (Deficiency UOF&R-1).", "CARE": "ODO reviewed RPDC’s purchasing procedures which were provided by the Food Service administrator (FSA) and found the facility’s purchase order form for potentially dangerous items such as nutmeg, yeast, and sugar did not include special handling procedures (Deficiency FS-1). The standard requires special handling procedures on purchase orders for items which may pose a security threat if not handled properly upon delivery. Corrective Action: The facility added special handling procedures to purchase order forms prior to the completion of the inspection (C-3). ODO toured the food service area and observed the air curtain mounted above the exit door leading from the kitchen to the rear dock was not operable at the time of the inspection (Deficiency FS-2). The facility submitted a purchase order for required parts to repair the air curtain during the inspection; however, corrective action to repair the air curtain was not completed prior to the end of the inspection. ODO reviewed water temperature logs for the facility’s dish washing machine and found water temperatures for the wash-cycle were not recorded; water temperatures were recorded only for the final rinse cycle (Deficiency FS-3). Corrective Action: Prior to the completion of the inspection, the facility revised the log form to include a section for recording wash-cycle water temperature readings (C-4). During observation of meal service in the dining room, ODO noted the food trays on the main serving line were wet. Through observation and interview with food service staff, ODO learned there are not enough food trays to serve the entire population; therefore, food trays must be continually washed and returned to the serving line before being properly air dried (Deficiency FS-4). ODO reviewed 37 medical records and found health assessments were completed within 14 days for all 37 detainees and physician review was documented. However, 21 of the 37 detainees had significant medical issues identified during intake screening, necessitating expedited health assessments. In none of the 21 cases were health assessments completed within two working days of the intake screening as required by the standard (Deficiency MC-1). ODO reviewed RPDC policy, Emerald Companies Health Service Policy, H-06, “Health Education and Wellness Information,” dated, January 1, 2015, and verified RPDC has procedures for placing detainees with chronic or special needs in a chronic care clinic for follow-up care. ODO found that in ten of 21 chronic care cases reviewed, complete treatment plans were not documented. In addition, ODO identified one of the chronic care patients was not enrolled in a chronic care clinic until she went into hypertensive crisis (Deficiency MC-2). ODO identified a detainee who was seen by a provider pursuant to a sick call request and was prescribed medication for hypertension. Review of the medication administration record found the detainee did not receive the medication for seven days following the order (Deficiency MC-3). RPDC has a medical/psychiatric alert form equivalent to the form used by the Immigration Health Service Corps. ODO found the forms present in 20 of 21 detainee records with medical conditions requiring close care; however, the medical record of a pregnant detainee with a history of methamphetamine use did not have the alert form (Deficiency MC-4). The acting HSA informed ODO that women would be referred to providers in the community for female-specific health care, if needed; however, no formal agreements with community providers for the provision of female-specific care were in place at the time of the inspection. Per facility policy H-28, “Female Health,” preventive services such as pap smears and mammograms are only offered to detainees who have been in uninterrupted custody for 12 months or more (Deficiency MC W-1). Through review of medical records and interviews with medical staff, ODO determined female detainees are not provided with information on services related to women’s health care as part of the initial intake screening (Deficiency MC W-2). During review of the medical records of eight female detainees, ODO noted the initial health assessment did not address female specific issues such as menstrual cycle, and history/family history of breast and gynecological problems (Deficiency MC W-3). ODO identified one female detainee who was first admitted to RPDC on October 7, 2015, at which time she reported she was pregnant. A pregnancy test administered during her intake screening confirmed she was pregnant and in her first trimester. Upon review of the detainee’s medical record, ODO found she did not receive health appraisal within 24 hours of arrival, as required by the standard (Deficiency MC W-4). Additionally, at no time was the detainee afforded access to specialized care, including an obstetric evaluation (Deficiency MC W-5). The detainee was transferred to another ICE facility on November 3, 2015 but transferred back to RPDC on January 26, 2016. During her intake screening at RPDC, the detainee reported she had a miscarriage while detained at the other facility. The medical record from the other facility did not accompany her to RPDC, and her transfer summary did not document the miscarriage.

ODO interviewed the Chief of Unit Management (COM), who stated that although LPCC has orientation videos and detainee handbooks available in both English and Spanish, the facility does not have a process to provide orientation to detainees who speak another language (Deficiency AR-18). Further, although the standard requires the facility to establish a process for obtaining a written translation of the handbook for significant segments of the population with limited English proficiency, LPCC has no established mode for translating the facility handbook into Punjabi or another language (Deficiency AR-29), and does not use telephonic interpretation to read the contents of the handbook to detainees who do not speak English or Spanish (Deficiency AR-310). ODO’s review of 30 detention files confirmed that detainees are consistently processed within 12 hours of arrival at the facility; however, ODO found nine Orders to Detain (I-203s) were either not signed by the appropriate ICE/ERO authorizing official or were incomplete (Deficiency AR-411).

Through staff interviews, ODO learned that facility staff are available to all detainees to assist with language needs when filing a grievance. Detainees can bypass or terminate the informal grievance system and proceed directly to the formal grievance process at any time. ODO learned that instead of conducting the initial adjudication of a formal or informal grievance his/herself, the Grievance Coordinator assigns officers to address all informal/formal detainee grievances (Deficiency GS-251). ODO found that although LPCC utilizes a Grievance Appeal Board (GAB), which is made up of available staff assigned at the time of the appeal, grievances are not responded to within five days (Deficiency GS-352). ODO observed that although LPCC posts the hours of operation for the law libraries on the bulletin boards inside each housing unit, in the hallways outside of the housing units, and both inside and outside of each law library, law library hours are not contained in the local supplement to the detainee handbook (Deficiency LL&LM-153).", "CONCLUSION": "During this inspection, ODO reviewed the facility’s compliance with 19 standards under the ICE PBNDS 2011. ODO found the facility fully compliant with five standards and identified 49 deficiencies in the remaining 13 standards. Four of the deficiencies resulted from the lack of FOD approval for facility written policy and procedures. ODO interviewed several detainees who voiced concern over the inability to understand the orientation and the handbook due to language barriers. The COM confirmed LPCC does not have a process to provide orientation to detainees who do not speak either English or Spanish and does not use telephonic interpretation services to explain the handbook to detainees who do not speak either English or Spanish. According to the facility roster, at the time of the inspection, LPCC had approximately 100 detainees whose primary language is Punjabi. ODO recommends LPCC make translation/interpretation services available to those detainees, as well as any other significant segments of the population with limited English proficiency, to ensure communication of orientation and handbook content. ODO noted two best practices in the medical care standard. First, LPCC added an infectious disease screening form to each detainee’s intake screening to screen detainees for varicella, mumps and influenza. Second, as identified during ODO’s interview with the Director of Nursing and review of detainee medical charts, LPCC conducts a non-fasting blood glucose finger stick reading at the time of intake for all known diabetic detainees to establish a baseline reading."}], "location_latitude": 32.215231, "location_longitude": -92.7158968, "location_address": "287 Industrial Drive, Jonesboro, LA 71251", "location_field_office": "New Orleans Field Office", "location_source": "csv_facilities", "name_similarity_score": 0.7741935483870968, "matched_facility_name": "Jackson Parish Correctional Center", "generated_summary": "A federal inspection of the detention facility revealed systemic failures, with the most glaring issue being repeated lapses in detainee release procedures—unsigned detention forms and missing checks during releases were flagged twice.

The nurse irrigated the detainee’s eye and instructed her to use warm compresses/washcloths to help with discomfort. On September 21, 2020, the facility’s medical provider examined the detainee’s eye for her follow-up appointment, noted the detainee had a stye to the lower lid of her eye, prescribed Gentamycin ointment to be applied several times a day for discomfort, and instructed the detainee to continue warm compresses. The detainee subsequently completed the course of eye ointment treatment. On October 18, 2020, a facility nurse examined the detainee for a complaint regarding swelling in her right eye. The nurse assessed the ailment as a minor irritation and educated the detainee on handwashing, keeping her fingers out of her eye, and applying a warm compress three times a day. The detainee did not have further eye-related complaints until March 2021. The facility’s medical staff provided care to the detainee several times in the facility’s sick call clinic for complaints not involving her eyes, from October 2020 to January 2021. During these visits, the detainee did not report any eye complaints or concerns and did not appear to have any apparent distress or abnormalities regarding her eyes, her walking, nor her ability to take care of herself safely and independently. On March 14, 2021, a facility nurse examined the detainee during sick call for reported eye pain, bilateral double vision, photosensitivity, and “seeing flashes.” The detainee underwent a vision test and was unable to see anything past the largest letter. Facility medical staff documented her bilateral vision at 20/200. However, the detainee was able to walk through the facility and to the medical unit without any assistance and did not stumble, have trouble seeing, or bump into objects. Additionally, the detainee had submitted several sick call request slips, which she had written herself and did not show any apparent changes in her writing that would indicate a moderate change in sight. During an exam on March 15, 2021, the detainee complained of double vision for over 30 days and denied any trauma to the eye. A physical exam noted no abnormalities, but the facility’s medical provider ordered a referral to an off-site ophthalmologist, which was pending ICE approval. At ODO’s request, the facility’s medical provider examined the detainee for chronic care management and a physical assessment on April 6, 2021. The detainee did not report any concerns or complaints regarding vision, hypertension, or pre-diabetes and appeared to be in no distress. Her vital signs were within normal limits and the physical exam findings were unremarkable.

The fans in these areas were also dusty and in need of cleaning. Inspectors also noted the smell of mold/mildew in Additionally, ODO notes one additional Area of Concern regarding two segregation cells located off the main hallway (Seg Right and Seg Left). During ODO’s initial tour of the facility, inspectors noted a county inmate was held in one of the cells (WCJ staff confirmed ICE detainees have and can be held in these cells). Both cells and the adjoining hallway were very dark with no operating light or discernable ambient light. ODO asked staff to turn on the lights and noted the hallway light and cell lights were on the same switch and cannot be operated independently of one another. Staff explained detainees prefer the cell lights to be off because the fixtures cause the cell area to become heated. As noted previously in this report, detainee housing areas were generally hot/humid with little air ventilation. Staff indicated the lights are not turned on until the evening (around 8 p.m. to 9 p.m.) to allow inmates/detainees time to read. It is unclear how long the lights remain on or what other times they are turned on (e.g. for meal periods, etc.). The vacant cell was exceptionally dirty and smelled strongly of mildew and there was trash strewn about the floor. By the end of ODO’s inspection, staff had thoroughly cleaned both segregation cells and the mildew smell had dissipated. While staff moved quickly to clean these areas, ODO remains concerned about the overall condition of this segregation area including the general lack of light and possibility inmates/detainees may be kept in the dark for excessive periods. ODO recommends the ERO field office engage with the facility on this issue and consider whether it is appropriate for ICE detainees to be held in these areas. Further, ODO recommends ERO work with the facility to resolve any other outstanding deficiencies as applicable and in accordance with contractual obligations."}, {"Detention Center": "Worcester County Jail", "Inspection Type": "Compliance Inspection", "URL": "https://www.ice.gov/doclib/foia/odo-compliance-inspections/WorchesterCoJailSnowHillMDJuly2020.pdf", "Inspection Date": "July 13-16, 2020", "Field Office": "ERO Baltimore", "Announced vs Unannounced": "N/A", "Environmental Health and Safety": 1, "Admission and Release": 2, "Custody Classification": 1, "System Facility": "N/A", "Security and Control": "N/A", "Funds and Personal Property": 1, "Post Orders": "N/A", "Searches of Detainees": "N/A", "Use of Force and Restraints": 1, "Special Management Units": "N/A", "Staff-Detainee Communication": "N/A", "Sexual Abuse and Assault Prevention and Intervention": 1, "Food Service": "N/A", "Hunger Strikes": "N/A", "Medical Care": 1, "Personal Hygiene Significant": "N/A", "Self-Harm and Suicide Prevention and Intervention": "N/A", "Correspondence and Other Mail": "N/A", "Religious Practices": "N/A", "Telephone Access": "N/A", "Voluntary Work Program": "N/A", "Grievance System": "N/A", "Law Libraries and Legal Materials": "N/A", "Detention Files Detainee Transfers": "N/A", "Total Deficiencies": 7, "Interviews Conducted": 3, "Interview Attempts Failed": 6, "SAFETY": "ODO found the facility’s Toxic, Caustic and Flammable Materials policy did not address proper chemical labeling (Deficiency EH&S -16).", "SECURITY": "ODO reviewed 12 detainee files and found one out of 12 files did not have the signature of the authorizing official on Form I-203, Orders to Release or Detain (Deficiency A&R-1)7.

ODO reviewed detainee detention files and found files did not contain a Form I-203, Order to Detain (Deficiency A&R-29). ODO observed CBDC’s detainee orientation process and found that ERO has not approved the facility’s orientation procedures and the facility orientation video does not include information on how detainees may contact the DO handling their docket. Additionally, there is no question-and-answer session following the orientation video (Deficiency A&R-310). Corrective Action: Prior to the completion of the inspection, ERO provided written documentation dated February 25, 2020, approving orientation procedures (C-1). ODO reviewed CBDC’s detainee release process and found ERO had not approved the release procedures and files reviewed for released detainees had a Form I-203a, Orders to Release, not addressed to CBDC or the facility name was left blank (Deficiency A&R-411). Corrective Action: Prior to the completion of the inspection, ERO provided written documentation dated February 25, 2020, approving CBDC’s detainee release procedures; correcting one of the two issues identified in the deficiency (C-2). ODO reviewed detainee files for detainees who arrived with funds and found were missing documentation of funds being returned at release; and files for detainees who arrived with valuables were missing documentation of return of valuables at release (Deficiency A&R-512). ODO reviewed the detainee intake process and found showers are not provided during intake. Detainees have the opportunity to shower once assigned to their housing unit; however, during intake, detainees sign prechecked forms stating, “Detainee declined to shower in the intake area.” ODO notes this as an Area of Concern. ODO reviewed the detainee intake process and found detainees sign a form at intake stating, “I have also received a three-minute phone call provided to all detainees,” when in fact phone calls are not provided during intake but in the housing unit. ODO notes this as an Area of Concern. ODO reviewed the detainee intake process and found detainees sign a form at intake stating, “I have watched the orientation video and received a copy of the Detainee Handbook…. I had the opportunity to ask questions about any concerns with the video or handbook.” The video is not shown during intake but rather in the housing unit. ODO notes this as an Area of Concern.", "CARE": "ODO observed safety shoes are not provided to food service personnel (Deficiency FS-120). ODO observed CBDC’s administrative health authority has not implemented procedures that provide for continuity of medical care in the event of a detainee’s change in detention placement or status; specifically, the in-transit medical review form (Deficiency MC-121). Corrective Action: Prior to the completion of the inspection, facility medical staff implemented a “USMS to ICE Rollover Review” form which will provide transfer of detainee medical information from USMS custody to ICE custody and upon release (C-5).", "ACTIVITIES": "ODO observed CBDC’s visitation process and found procedures required that general visitors (detainee immediate family, other relatives, friends, etc.) and legal visitors utilize the same visitor log to record visits (Deficiency V-122). ODO observed that in practice the facility does not require approved visitor lists from detainees; however, CBDC’s policy for Detainee Visiting - Official Visits, IV.B.3., page 2, requires detainees to have attorneys on the “Detainee's Visitor List as Attorney of Record.” ODO notes this as an Area of Concern.", "JUSTICE": "N/A", "CONCLUSION": "During this inspection, ODO assessed the facility’s compliance with 16 standards under PBNDS 2008 and two standards under PBNDS 2011 and found the facility in compliance with nine out of 18 standards. ODO found 17 deficiencies in the remaining nine standards. ODO commends facility staff for their responsiveness during this inspection and notes there were five instances where staff initiated immediate corrective action during the inspection. ODO also notes that on the final day of the inspection, the facility provided proposed corrective actions for all remaining findings; absent requiring food service personal wear safety shoes. The facility stated it would never provide inmates, who comprise the food service staff, with steel-toed shoes as required by the definition of “safety shoes.” Most detainees at CBDC are initially USMS inmates who upon conclusion of a court appearance, are transferred to ICE custody, and remain at the facility on average 24-72 hours. ODO noted six Areas of Concern, which included accountability of required protective equipment for Calculated UOF situations. ODO recommends ERO work with the facility to resolve any deficiencies that remain outstanding in accordance with contractual obligations."}, {"Detention Center": "Coastal Bend Detention Center", "Inspection Type": "Compliance Inspection", "URL": "https://www.ice.gov/doclib/foia/odo-compliance-inspections/2021-CoastalBendDF-RobstownTX-January.pdf", "Inspection Date": "January 11-14, 2021", "Field Office": "ERO Houston Field Office", "Announced vs Unannounced": "N/A", "Environmental Health and Safety": "N/A", "Admission and Release": "N/A", "Custody Classification": "N/A", "System Facility": "N/A", "Security and Control": "N/A", "Funds and Personal Property": "N/A", "Post Orders": "N/A", "Searches of Detainees": "N/A", "Use of Force and Restraints": "N/A", "Special Management Units": "N/A", "Staff-Detainee Communication": "N/A", "Sexual Abuse and Assault Prevention and Intervention": "N/A", "Food Service": "N/A", "Hunger Strikes": "N/A", "Medical Care": "N/A", "Personal Hygiene Significant": "N/A", "Self-Harm and Suicide Prevention and Intervention": "N/A", "Correspondence and Other Mail": "N/A", "Religious Practices": "N/A", "Telephone Access": "N/A", "Voluntary Work Program": "N/A", "Grievance System": "N/A", "Law Libraries and Legal Materials": "N/A", "Detention Files Detainee Transfers": "N/A", "Total Deficiencies": 0, "Interviews Conducted": 12, "Interview Attempts Failed": 0, "SAFETY": "N/A", "SECURITY": "N/A", "CARE": "N/A", "ACTIVITIES": "N/A", "JUSTICE": "N/A", "CONCLUSION": "N/A"}, {"Detention Center": "Coastal Bend Detention Center", "Inspection Type": "Compliance Inspection", "URL": "https://www.ice.gov/doclib/foia/odo-compliance-inspections/coastalBendDetCntrRobstownTX_Feb6-8_2018.pdf", "Inspection Date": "February 6 - 8, 2018", "Field Office": "ERO Houston Field Office", "Announced vs Unannounced": "N/A", "Environmental Health and Safety": 2, "Admission and Release": 1, "Custody Classification": 0, "System Facility": "N/A", "Security and Control": "N/A", "Funds and Personal Property": 3, "Post Orders": "N/A", "Searches of Detainees": "N/A", "Use of Force and Restraints": 2, "Special Management Units": 0, "Staff-Detainee Communication": 2, "Sexual Abuse and Assault Prevention and Intervention": 0, "Food Service": 1, "Hunger Strikes": "N/A", "Medical Care": 7, "Personal Hygiene Significant": "N/A", "Self-Harm and Suicide Prevention and Intervention": 0, "Correspondence and Other Mail": "N/A", "Religious Practices": "N/A", "Telephone Access": 0, "Voluntary Work Program": "N/A", "Grievance System": 0, "Law Libraries and Legal Materials": 0, "Detention Files Detainee Transfers": "N/A", "Total Deficiencies": 18, "Interviews Conducted": 18, "Interview Attempts Failed": 0, "SAFETY": "ODO inspected the detainee housing units and determined the overall sanitary conditions did not meet acceptable standards. Specifically, ODO found: trash was strewn about floors; graffiti was present on the walls of several cells; and shower and bathroom areas in the majority of the units had a build-up of lime, hard water deposits, soap scum, and dirt (Deficiency EH&S-1). Corrective Action: The facility initiated corrective action during the inspection and cleaned these areas. ODO visited these areas again and found the showers had been scrubbed, trash picked up and the overall sanitation level of the housing units was significantly improved (C-1). ODO reviewed the facility-provided quarterly fire drill records and determined, fire drills are conducted in all areas of the facility to include drawing and testing of emergency keys; however, all detainees are not evacuated during the fire drills for all locations (Deficiency EH&S-2).", "SECURITY": "ODO reviewed 30 detention files and determined the required Order to Detain or Release, Form I-203 was missing in five files. Additionally, seven other files contained an unsigned Form I-203 (Deficiency A&R-1). ODO toured the detainee housing units and found detainees are provided with a pull-out steel drawer built into each steel bunkbed to store detainee personal property. The drawers are to be secured by a locking device such as a padlock; however, detainees are not provided with any means to secure their property (Deficiency F&PP-1). ODO observed the admission process for detainees. Detainee property is searched upon arrival, inventoried, and placed in individual zippered hanging bags in the secured property room. A copy of the inventory receipt signed by the detainee and two facility staff members is placed inside each property bag. In addition to the inventory placed inside each bag, the detainee’s identifying information is placed in a clear plastic pocket on the front of each bag. However, ODO found detainee property bags are not secured in a tamper-resistant manner (Deficiency F&PP-2). Corrective Action: The facility initiated corrective action during the inspection by having intake staff secure each property bag with a tamper-resistant seal (C-2). ODO observed the release of five detainees from the facility and found funds and property are returned to the detainee, and they are asked to sign a CBDC Itemized Property Form. However, the form only documents that detainees receive their property, but does not indicate the detainee received funds prior to departure (Deficiency F&P-3). ODO reviewed the ERO-provided visitation logbook entries going back to July 2017. ODO determined ERO staff conducts weekly scheduled and unscheduled visits at CBDC. However, visits to the facility by supervisory staff are not documented in the logbooks (Deficiency SDC-1). ODO reviewed 30 detainee detention files and also reviewed the ICE detainee request log. Five detention files were for detainees who submitted requests to ICE. However, the completed Detainee Requests forms were missing from all five files (Deficiency SDC-2). ODO inspected the facility’s protective equipment and determined it is available for cell extraction team members. Equipment However, the storage area for the equipment serves as a multi-purpose room for computer training and is not secure (Deficiency UOF&R-1). Corrective Action: The facility initiated corrective action during the inspection by establishing procedures to secure the door to the room and modified their UOF&R policy to include the securing of the door (C-3). ODO observed stationary ceiling video cameras strategically placed throughout the facility. ODO also observed hand-held digital video cameras are maintained in central control and each unit control center. However, the facility administrator has not incorporated maintenance and testing of audiovisual equipment in the post orders (Deficiency UOF&R-2). Corrective Action: The facility initiated corrective action during the inspection by incorporating the requirement for maintenance and testing equipment into the Orders (C-4).", "CARE": "ODO observed a production supervisor checking the temperature of the hot and cold items before tray preparation. Staff record temperature checks on the opening and closing checklist for each meal. ODO checked the temperatures and found all food items within proper temperature guidelines for hot and cold food items at the tray preparation area. However, the temperatures for hot food items when delivered to the housing units were between 100 to 115 degrees for ten randomly selected trays (Deficiency FS-1). ODO reviewed 45 detainee medical records and determined that initial detainee medical and mental health screenings are completed by licensed vocational nurses (LVN); however, the clinical medical authority (MA) does not review intake screening forms to assess priority for treatment (Deficiency MC-1). ODO reviewed detainee medical records and found initial health and dental appraisals are performed by trained registered nurses (RNs) or the physician. ODO found nine appraisals that were neither signed nor dated and three appraisals left undated. (Deficiency MC-2). ODO’s review of ten sick call requests found the requests were not addressed by medical staff within 48 hours from the time of the request. In one case, a detainee submitted a request on January 21 and 22, 2018 and he was not seen until January 25, 2018. Another detainee submitted a request on January 16, 2018 and did not receive a response until February 1, 2018 (Deficiency MC-3). ODO reviewed the CBDC’s list of stock prescription medications available at the facility for immediate medication administration and for chronic care conditions. During its records review, ODO identified a diabetic detainee who arrived at CBDC on January 20, 2018 with a blood sugar level of 320. Although it was readily available, the detainee did not receive medication until five days after arrival. Additionally, while treatment protocols clearly state staff must call the physician when blood sugars are below 50 or above 400. ODO found documentation that nursing staff administered insulin for a detainee with blood sugar levels 38, 40, and 43; however, there was no corresponding documentation showing the physician was consulted (Deficiency MC-4). ODO’s review of detainee medical files found a lack of follow-up and inconsistency in the continuity of care in several cases (Deficiency MC-5). For example, in one instance medical staff failed to adequately follow up and document suture removal, dressing changes, and evaluation by an orthopedic surgeon for a detainee with an open fracture. In another instance, a detainee on a multi-drug treatment regimen due to tuberculosis exposure with documented weight loss did not receive scheduled follow-up assessments as ordered. Additionally, ODO could find no documentation showing several detainees received an infectious disease consultation as ordered during their intake at the facility. CBDC detainee medical records consist of a single manila folder and are securely maintained. ODO’s review of the medical files found they are not complete and documentation related to consultations, clinical encounters, and medical administration records were not always included in the file (Deficiency MC-6). According to CBDC policy, detainees request non-emergency medical care by placing requests in a lockbox located outside the housing unit. However, ODO observed detainees instead place their requests in their cell windows as the lockbox is not always accessible within the unit. Placing medically-sensitive documents in cell windows allows for correctional staff and other detainees to potentially access private medical information (Deficiency MC-7).", "ACTIVITIES": "N/A", "JUSTICE": "N/A", "CONCLUSION": "During this inspection, ODO reviewed the facility’s compliance with fifteen (15) standards under the PBNDS 2008. Although the number of deficiencies identified at this facility has been cut nearly in half since its last ODO inspection, the facility remained compliant with eight (8) standards. CBDC was deficient eighteen (18) times in the remaining seven (7) standards. Five (5) of those deficiencies were priority components and two (2) were repeat deficiencies. ODO recommends ERO work with the facility to remedy all remaining deficiencies, as applicable and in accordance with contractual obligations."}], "location_latitude": 27.7370237, "location_longitude": -97.7547511, "location_address": "4909 Farm to Market Road, Robstown, TX 78380", "location_field_office": "Harlingen Field Office", "location_source": "csv_facilities", "name_similarity_score": 1.0, "matched_facility_name": "Coastal Bend Detention Center", "generated_summary": "A 2020 inspection of CBDC revealed systemic failures in detainee care and security, with the most egregious issue being repeated medical neglect—including delayed insulin for a diabetic detainee with a blood sugar level of 320 and unaddressed sick calls for days.

ODO reviewed the facility’s TA policy and found detainee telephone calls were limited to 15 minutes. However, ODO interviewed the facility Accreditation Manager and several detainees, all of whom stated there were no time restrictions placed on telephone calls. Nevertheless, the local policy was contradictory to both the standard and observed practice. As such, ODO noted this as an Area of Concern. Corrective Action: Prior to the end of the inspection, the facility updated all detainee housing unit telephone listings with the most current lists of pro bono legal resources and postings for consulates and embassies (C-2). ODO reviewed the facility’s visitation logs and found that the facility did not record detainees’ alien-registration numbers (Deficiency V-148).

Further, NCDC does not maintain documentation indicating the date, time, and name of the officer(s) who conducted the inventory (F&PP-313). ODO interviewed the supervisory lieutenant regarding NCDC’s funds and personal property program and found they do not have a written procedure for detainee property reported as missing or damaged (F&PP-414). As a result of not having established procedures, ODO found supervisory staff do not conduct the missing or damaged property investigation (F&PP-515). ODO found NCDC does not have established procedures for detainee property reported as missing or damaged, resulting in detainees not being promptly reimbursed for all validated property losses caused by facility negligence (F&PP-616). Furthermore, because established procedures do not exist, ICE/ERO is not immediately notified of all claims and outcomes (F&PP-717). ODO made numerous attempts to obtain pictures and/or scanned copies of the detainee property log(s); however, the facility did not provide the requested information in which the detention standard, Inventory and Audit, could not be fully reviewed. ODO cited this area as deficient, because it could not be verified that detainees are notified in writing if their property was shipped or destroyed, as the property log reflects the detainee’s property transaction (F&PP-818). Special Management Units: ODO reviewed NCDC’s policy 0078A, Special Management Units, dated November 30, 2019, and found NCDC had written procedures for regular review of detainees in administrative segregation (AS) status; however, the supervisor was directed to conduct a review within 96 hours and not 72 hours (SMU-119). Furthermore, the policy did not address subsequent reviews (SMU-220), nor giving a copy of the review to the detainee or the right to appeal (SMU-321). Additionally, the policy directed the medical department visit each detainee in SMU 'at least three times a week' and a qualified health care provider did not conduct a psychological review every 30 days (SMU-422). NCDC reported three detainees were placed in AS status the year preceding the ODO’s inspection. ODO reviewed the detainees’ files and found NCDC did not complete a written AS order in all three instances (SMU-523). Therefore, the detainees did not receive a copy (SMU-624); nor was it forwarded to ICE/ERO (SMU-725); and subsequently the date and time of release was not noted on the AS order and not placed in the detainees’ files (SMU-826). ODO also noted in the review of the three detainees’ records, they were not observed at least every 30-minutes on an irregular basis (SMU-927). ODO reviewed NCDC’s policy 0078B, Disciplinary Segregation Unit, dated November 30, 2019, and found it did not address a review of detainees in disciplinary segregation every seven days (SMU-1028); or subsequently giving the detainee a copy of the seven-day review (SMU-1129). An interview with the captain confirmed the missing information. ODO reviewed NCDC’s policy 0049, Inmate Disciplinary Procedures, dated May 15, 2016, and found the policy stated detainees may serve a maximum of 60 days disciplinary segregation (DS), per infraction and time served in pre-disciplinary detention 'may' be deducted from the time ordered by the IDP (SMU-1230). ODO reviewed NCDC’s policy 0076, ICE Detainees, dated November 30, 2019, and found it did not address notifications to ICE/ERO for detainees in extended segregation placement (SMU-1331). An interview with the captain also confirmed the missing information. NCDC reported one detainee was placed in disciplinary segregation (DS) the year preceding the ODO inspection. ODO reviewed the detainee file and found the detainee was charged, found guilty, and sanctioned of possessing intoxicants within an eight-hour period (SMU-1432). Furthermore, the file did not contain a written DS order (SMU-1533). Therefore, the reason for placement was absent (SMU-1634); a copy was not provided to the detainee (SMU-1735); and subsequently, the date and time of release was not noted on the DS order and not placed in the detainee file (SMU-1836). An interview with the lieutenant confirmed an absence of the DS order procedures and disciplinary panel procedures.", "CARE": "Food Service: ODO reviewed the job descriptions for inmate food service workers and found the most recent review by the food service administrator was completed in September 2018, which should be completed annually (FS-137). Additionally, the staff reported the inmate food service workers received orientation and training when assigned to the department; however, there was no documentation to record the training (FS-238). The facility used the common fare menu as the base for all religious meals; however, it did not provide special menus for the ten federal holidays (FS-339). ODO reviewed documentation and found two detainees were approved to receive halal meals; however, the meals were prepared on-site following the common fare menu (FS-440). Additionally, the meals were not served on disposable trays, insulated trays or trays set aside specifically for common-fare use only (FS-541). The meals were served on the same insulated trays used by the general population with a sticker denoting the type of meal and recipient’s name. ODO interviewed staff and reviewed documentation and found staff and inmates did not have health screenings, prior to placement in the kitchen (FS-642). Specifically, Summit Food Service provided a food service administrator to provide financial management of the food service operation. Her employment began three weeks prior and she informed ODO she did not have a medical screening prior to starting in the kitchen. Two NCDC employees were employed in the kitchen to manage the inmate food service workers prepare and serve the meals and stated they had not been medically screened for work in the kitchen. NCDC was unable to provide documentation an independent inspection was completed for the food service department (FS-743). Specifically, the captain stated a copy of the health inspection was provided during the review; however, the only document received by ODO referencing a health inspection was from the Department of Health and Human Services, Department of Public and Behavioral Health. The document did not indicate what area of the jail was inspected, what items were looked at, or what the findings were.

While detainees wear wrist bands to identify their classification level, the facility only has three classification levels: low, medium, and high. However, ICE typically classifies detainees using a four-level system: low, medium-low, medium-high, and high. The facility’s classification levels may allow for a low or medium-low detainee to be housed with a medium-high or high detainee, which is an Area of Concern. ODO interviewed the case manager and associate warden, who both stated, contrary to facility policy, a detainee who arrives without a classification assignment from ERO El Paso would default to a high level and be housed with high level detainees, which is an Area of Concern.", "CARE": "ODO reviewed the food service menus and found the facility does not have a special common fare menu for the 10 federal holidays (Deficiency FS-6017).

Rather, ERO emails a memorandum to the facility staff and this serves as the release/transfer certificate (Deficiency A&R-29). ODO inspected 12 detainee files and found three initial assessments had not been conducted by the facility staff upon the detainees’ admission to the facility. Additionally, classification for the three detainees was completed 7 to 12-months prior to admission to the facility and the detainees’ classification was not reassessed upon arrival to the facility (Deficiency CCS-110).

Review of the laundry operations found the laundry carts used to transport the dirty clothing to the laundry are not being disinfected before clean clothes are placed in them for transport back to the living units (Deficiency EH&S-2).9).", "SECURITY": "Upon arrival, a detainee’s personal clothing is inventoried, and a receipt is signed by the detainee and staff. The remaining property is placed in a lockable bin located in the intake hallway, is processed the following morning, and not inventoried or inspected upon arrival to ensure contraband, including hazardous material, does not enter the facility (Deficiency A&R-110). ODO observed the admission process at YCJ and found fingerprints are not completed on all detainees admitted into the facility (DeficiencyA&R-211). ODO interviewed staff and examined both admissions changing areas and determined detainees are not afforded privacy (Deficiency A&R-312). There are two changing areas in intake and neither area provides privacy. One changing area is surrounded by a privacy curtain that does not fully enclose a detainee changing their clothes and the other has a pass through window that is not covered. At any time, a detainee is changing they can be observed by either intake staff, detainee voluntary workers, or anyone passing by the curtain or pass through window. YCP policy prohibits strip searches unless there is documented suspicion and supervisory approval. ODO reviewed documentation and confirmed with the area lieutenant, and the DSM, that female detainees were strip searched, with the rationale indicated as \"new admit\" (Deficiency A&R-413). Corrective Action: The DSM sent an email dated December 4, 2019, reminding staff to follow requirements regarding strip searches. ODO found that the use of the strip-searches were discontinued after the email was sent from the DSM (C-1). ODO reviewed the files of ten released detainees and documentation reflects funds, property and valuables are returned to the detainee, he/she signs as receiving the property, and a signed I-203 was available. However, ODO found the local ERO office had not approved the release procedures for YCP (Deficiency A&R-514). Corrective Action: Prior to completion of the inspection, the AFOD issued a memorandum on January 8, 2020, approving the release procedures at YCP (C-2).", "CARE": "ODO’s review of 37 files found 14 files had no documentation of supervisory review of the classification for accuracy and completeness (Deficiency CS-115). ODO noted an Area of Concern that ODO requested key data elements from the commander which would demonstrate detainees are transitioned from SMU to less restrictive housing promptly. According to the commander, YCP does not maintain information of detainees previously segregated in SMU. The commander attempted to gather this information; however, based on the information subsequently provided, ODO could not determine the number of detainees housed in SMU during the year preceding the inspection. This information is pertinent for inspection teams to effectively and accurately determine standard compliance. ODO noted an Area of Concern that ODO’s review of files found various SMU documents throughout the facility in both hard copy and electronic form at various locations; SMUs, records office, unit office’s and electronically on computer. YCP’s system of document control is not conducive to an expedient file review as documents are not easily accessible.", "ACTIVITIES": "ODO observed religious service schedules posted on housing unit bulletin boards, which ensured detainees were aware of the schedule of services; however, they were not posted in Spanish (Deficiency RP-125). Facility staff do not inspect telephones daily to ensure systems are operational nor is telephone maintenance information logged (Deficiency TA-126). The facility does not log, nor does it report identified telephone maintenance issues to ICE staff (Deficiency TA-227). Additionally, the facility does not place a notice at each monitored telephone stating, the procedure for obtaining an unmonitored called to a court, a legal representative, or to obtain legal representation nor does it provide this notice in the next most prevalent language (Deficiency TA-328). The facility has posted listings for pro-bono services, consulates, embassies, and ICE numbers near the telephones in each unit, but the facility does not post telephone access rules in an area, where detainees can easily see them or in a language they can understand (Deficiency TA-429). Furthermore, the facility does not post updated OIG posters in the detainee housing units (Deficiency TA-530).", "JUSTICE": "ODO found facility general grievance response times were set at 5-10 days and appeal response times were set at within 21 days from the receipt of an appeal which both exceed the mandatory five days. Detainees unsatisfied with the determination made may first appeal their grievance to the Deputy Warden of Centralized Services and then to the York County Solicitor. ODO determined the facility administrator, or designee, does not provide detainees a written decision within five days of receiving an appeal (Deficiency GS-131). ODO found that written grievances, that cannot be resolved to the satisfaction of detainees, are not acted upon within five working days of receipt when referred to the next level of supervision or the appropriate department head (Deficiency GS-232). ODO determined the Grievance Coordinators do not provide detainees a written decision no later than fifteen working days after receipt of the detainee’s appeal and do not include an explanation for delays in decisions. Additionally, the facility does not allow detainees to appeal the grievance directly to the facility administrator if the detainee does not receive a written response within that 15-day time frame (Deficiency GS-333). Although the facility grievance coordinators track and maintain detainee general and medical grievances electronically in their files, ODO noted copies of the grievances were not in all detainee detention files which are separately maintained by the YCP records department (Deficiency GS-434).", "CONCLUSION": "N/A"}, {"Detention Center": "York County Prison", "Inspection Type": "OVERSIGHT INSPECTION", "URL": "https://www.ice.gov/doclib/foia/odo-compliance-inspections/yorkPaAug22_24_2017.pdf", "Inspection Date": "August 22-24, 2017", "Field Office": "ERO Philadelphia Field Office", "Announced vs Unannounced": "N/A", "Environmental Health and Safety": 1, "Admission and Release": 1, "Custody Classification": 1, "System Facility": "N/A", "Security and Control": "N/A", "Funds and Personal Property": "N/A", "Post Orders": "N/A", "Searches of Detainees": "N/A", "Use of Force and Restraints": "N/A", "Special Management Units": 1, "Staff-Detainee Communication": 2, "Sexual Abuse and Assault Prevention and Intervention": "N/A", "Food Service": 8, "Hunger Strikes": "N/A", "Medical Care": "N/A", "Personal Hygiene Significant": "N/A", "Self-Harm and Suicide Prevention and Intervention": "N/A", "Correspondence and Other Mail": "N/A", "Religious Practices": "N/A", "Telephone Access": 1, "Voluntary Work Program": "N/A", "Grievance System": 2, "Law Libraries and Legal Materials": 4, "Detention Files Detainee Transfers": "N/A", "Total Deficiencies": 21, "Interviews Conducted": 24, "Interview Attempts Failed": 0, "SAFETY": "ODO found the sanitation of facility areas to be acceptable and safety measures to be in place, with the exception of the monthly fire drills.

Corrective Action: Prior to the completion of the inspection, the Field Office issued a memorandum approving the procedures (C-1). ODO’s review of classification documentation and housing unit rosters confirmed detainees were appropriately housed. However, ODO observed Level III detainees moving unescorted throughout the facility. Facility staff confirmed Level III detainees are only escorted when assigned to disciplinary or administrative segregation (Deficiency CS-110). Religious services are provided for SMU detainees; however, YCP does not have procedures to allow detainees to retain religious items in their possession (Deficiency SMU-111). The schedule identifying the day of ICE officer visits is not posted in all housing units (Deficiency SDC-112). Also, notices highlighting the Department of Homeland Security, Office of Inspector General hotline and the Detainee Reporting Information Line (DRIL) posters are not posted in each housing unit where detainees are able to routinely see them (Deficiency SDC-213).", "CARE": "The food service areas were clean and well organized; however, ODO observed the grease filters in ventilation hoods and heat shields for the deep fat fryers were soiled with grease and food debris (Deficiency FS-114). ODO’s inspection of the storage areas found food items stored on metal shelving units and wood pallets were not properly spaced from the walls (Deficiency FS-215). Although ODO did not observe any signs of pests, proper spacing in accordance with the standard is essential for the facilitation of pest control measures. ODO found the exit door located at the rear of the food service area leading outside is not equipped with an air curtain (Deficiency FS-316). Air curtains are required to prevent insects from entering the buildings and contaminating food products. Additionally, ODO observed water leaking from the ceiling in the large walk-in cooler (Deficiency FS-417). ODO observed the tray preparation of the noon meal on Tuesday, August 22, 2017 and found the beef patties were not maintained at 140 F degrees (Deficiency FS-518). Corrective Action: The Food Service Authority (FSA) immediately had the beef patties removed from the serving line and replaced with patties that were 157 F degrees (C-2). ODO observed food temperatures are not recorded on assembly line #1 for medical diet trays (Deficiency FS-619). Maintaining food temperatures is essential to prevent food-borne illness and logging the temperatures demonstrates compliance with proper temperatures. Further, hot foods are not placed in a heated serving line during tray assembly (DeficiencyFS-720). Corrective Action: During the inspection food service personnel began documenting food temperatures for assembly line #1 in the daily activity log book, and the FSA modified the assembly line food temperature log sheet to include assembly line #1(C-3). The staff restroom and detainee restroom were observed to be equipped with hot and cold water, soap, paper towels, and signs directing workers to wash hands before returning to work. However, ODO found the stand-alone hand-washing units throughout the kitchen area were not equipped with hot water, soap, and hand-wash signs (Deficiency FS-821).", "ACTIVITIES": "In several housing units, notices that detainee phone calls are subject to monitoring and how to request an unmonitored call are not located near the phones or where they can be seen while using the phones (Deficiency TA-122).", "JUSTICE": "ODO reviewed facility grievance policies and noted the response times were set at 10 days which exceeds the mandatory five days called for in the standard. ODO reviewed 30 medical records and determined only 33% met the five–day requirement, though all grievances received a response (Deficiency GS-123). Additionally, ODO reviewed 98 non-medical grievance records and found just 64% met the five-day requirement (Deficiency GS-224). There is no designated law library coordinator who inspects the law library unit on a daily basis (Deficiency LL&LM-125). The facility handbook or equivalent does not provide detainees with the scheduled hours of access to the law library (Deficiency LL&LM-226). The facility handbook or equivalent does not provide detainees with the procedure for requesting legal reference materials not maintained in the law library (Deficiency LL&LM-327).

While inspecting the medical department, ODO also found the facility does not maintain documentation that sharps are properly inventoried and accounted for on a weekly basis (Deficiency EH&S-28). Although facility staff developed a Bulk Weekly Sharps Cabinet Inventory sheet, they do not complete it on a regular basis; the facility was only able to produce one completed inventory sheet, dated December 4, 2018.", "SECURITY": "ODO found that because the facility’s booking area does not have any shower facilities, detainees are not able to shower until placed into their assigned housing unit (Deficiency AR-19). Upon admission, detainees are provided information about the Prison Rape Elimination Act (PREA), facility rules, visitation, barbering services, laundry, and law library schedules via the detainee handbook and postings throughout the facility. ODO viewed the facility’s orientation videos and confirmed they were thorough, informed detainees about their rights, and provided information about PREA. Although JCCC’s orientation procedures were comprehensive, ODO found no documentation that ERO approved them (Deficiency AR-210). • Corrective Action: Prior to the completion of the inspection, ERO took corrective action by providing a memorandum approving JCCC’s admission and orientation procedures (C-1). JCCC booking officers use the ICE Custody Classification worksheet, information provided by ERO (Order to Detain or Release Form I-203), and the detainee’s criminal history to complete detainee classification. The classification is signed by the booking supervisor. ODO reviewed 25 randomly-selected detainee files and found the Form I-203 does not consistently contain a signature of the authorizing official (Deficiency AR-311). ODO found that JCCC policy outlines the release process and that booking staff understand the steps involved in a detainee release; however, the release procedures were not approved by ERO (Deficiency AR-412). • Corrective Action: Prior to the completion of the inspection, ERO took corrective action by providing a memorandum approving the release procedures (C-2).", "CARE": "ODO found that although JCCC has a written Disability Identification, Assessment, and Accommodation (DIAA) policy, it is not based on requirements within the ICE PBNDS 2011 (Deficiency DIA&A-124). ODO found that while JCCC provides staff training on disability and reasonable accommodations, facility contractors and volunteers who have contact with detainees are not provided training or notified of the facility’s disability accommodations policy (Deficiency DIA&A-225). Although both the JCCC local facility handbook and orientation program generally inform detainees of their right to an accommodation based on a disability, neither informs detainees how to request a reasonable accommodation (Deficiency DIA&A-326). ODO notes that during the inspection, the facility posted ERO’s Detention Reporting and Information Line (DRIL) poster, which includes general information on reasonable accommodations, in both English and Spanish. ODO reviewed the credential files for medical staff and found not all health care staff had a timely, verifiable license or certification on file and not all credential documents were on site or readily available (Deficiency MC-127). ODO learned that as a standard practice, LaSalle Southwest Corrections keeps licenses, certifications and registrations in personnel folders at their company headquarters location. During the inspection, the licenses, certifications, and registrations were made available for ODO’s review on March 28, 2019, and ODO confirmed all documents were current. ODO’s review of training records of medical staff and correctional staff found staff are not consistently provided with training for cardio pulmonary resuscitation (CPR) (Deficiency MC-228). JCCC conducts tuberculosis (TB) screening by way of purified protein derivative or chest X-ray. ODO’s review of files found detainees are not consistently screened for TB prior to admission into the general population (Deficiency MC-329). ODO observed the medication refrigerator thermometer has designated zones demarcated by colors: yellow for temperatures considered too low, green for temperatures considered adequate and red for temperatures considered too warm. ODO observed the temperature reading was in the red zone during the first and last days of the inspection, signifying the temperature in the refrigerator was too warm (Deficiency MC-430). ODO interviewed the HSA, who reported that because JCCC’s health services department is not always notified in advance of a detainee’s release or transfer (Deficiency MC-531), a medical summary or copy of the detainee’s medical record is not always prepared and does not always accompany outgoing detainees (Deficiency MC-632). ODO reviewed the medical file of a detainee who had been in custody for over one year and found that while his initial screening and physical assessment were completed timely, there was no documentation that he received a comprehensive annual physical exam, for which he was due in December 2018 (Deficiency MC-733). Additionally, the detainee’s medical record reflected that he repeatedly requested a dental cleaning in December 2018, February 2019, and March 2019, but his record showed no evidence that he received any dental prophylaxis as of the date of ODO’s inspection (Deficiency MC-834). JCCC has a written policy and a comprehensive suicide prevention training program that meets the requirements of the standard and states training is provided for new staff and annually thereafter. ODO reviewed the training records of all medical and correctional staff and found the HSA did not have documentation of the required suicide prevention training (Deficiency SS-H&SPI-135). ODO’s review of medical documentation found JCCC placed seven detainees on suicide watch during the year preceding the inspection. ODO reviewed all seven files and found six did not contain suicide watch logs documenting checks and continuous monitoring or checks by clinical staff at least . Additionally, ODO found JCCC did not consistently provide one-to-one monitoring for three detainees who were assigned to continuous watch (Deficiency SS-H&SPI-236). ODO’s file review found two of the seven files for detainees on suicide watch did not contain documentation specific to the date when the watch was discontinued or who gave the order to release the detainee from suicide watch (Deficiency SS-H&SPI-337).", "ACTIVITIES": "ODO observed that JCCC appropriately posted free legal services information, pro bono lists, consulate lists, and the Department of Homeland Security Office of Inspector General (OIG) poster in every housing unit; however, ODO found the pro bono lists were outdated (January 2018) (Deficiency TA-138). • Corrective Action: Prior to the completion of the inspection, the facility initiated corrective action by obtaining an updated pro bono list and posting it in each housing unit (C-3). The facility’s free call platform was not up-to-date, having been updated most recently on February 28, 2018 (Deficiency TA-239). • Corrective Action: Prior to the completion of the inspection, the facility initiated corrective action by obtaining an updated free call platform list and posting it in each housing pod (C-4). The facility’s telephone system has a recorded message that advises detainees their calls are subject to monitoring; however, ODO found that four of the nine housing units were missing notices that detainee calls are subject to monitoring (Deficiency TA-3). Directions for unmonitored calls were also not posted in each housing unit. • Corrective Action: Prior to the completion of the inspection, the facility initiated corrective action by posting notices that calls are subject to monitoring, as well as guidance on how to obtain an unmonitored call, in each housing unit (C-5).", "JUSTICE": "ODO found that JCCC does not maintain a copy of detainee grievances in the detainee’s folder (Deficiency GS-140). ODO also found that while JCCC responds to medical grievances in a timely fashion, copies of resolved medical grievances are not placed in detainee medical files (Deficiency DGP-241).", "CONCLUSION": "During this inspection, ODO reviewed the facility’s compliance with 19 standards under the ICE PBNDS 2011. ODO found the facility to be compliant with seven standards and identified 36 deficiencies in the remaining 12 standards. Within those deficient standards, ODO identified 16 deficient priority components, including five priority component deficiencies in the Medical Care standard and two in the Significant Self-Harm - Suicide Prevention and Intervention standard. The HSA informed ODO that because JCCC’s health services department is not always notified in advance of a detainee’s release or transfer, a medical summary or copy of the detainee’s medical record is not always prepared and does not always accompany the outgoing detainee. ODO notes an up-to-date and accurate medical summary will help to ensure adequate continuity of care for those detainees being transferred or released. ODO also notes that JCCC utilizes a paper medical records system and that medical files are not organized uniformly, which makes it difficult to navigate and find documents. To ensure consistency of care, ODO recommends JCCC organize medical records uniformly and maintain chronological notes. Additionally, ODO recommends ERO and the JCCC senior corrections staff work closely with the HSA and facility medical staff to ensure detainee medical records are available for departing detainees. The transition from the ICE NDS 2000 standards to the PBNDS 2011 standards has potentially been difficult for the facility as demonstrated by the increased number of deficiencies and the number of deficient priority components. The facility was fully cooperative with the ODO inspections team and in five instances took immediate corrective action to resolve a deficiency. ODO recommends ERO work closely with the facility to complete the facility’s transition to PBNDS 2011 and remedy any deficiencies that remain outstanding in accordance with contractual obligations."}], "location_latitude": 42.3166565, "location_longitude": -85.1757947, "location_address": "185 E.

ODO reviewed the facility’s policy and procedures and determined the facility did not have a SAAPI policy or program in place at the facility (Deficiency SAAPI-19).", "CARE": "ODO interviewed supervisory staff and found all staff and inmates assigned to food service had received a pre-employment medical clearance to work in a food handling environment as required by the standard. However, a further review found Country Table, a contracted caterer, provided bulk cooked food to KCJ. ODO was unable to verify if Country Table staff were receiving medical clearances. While Country Table was not serving the meals to detainees, nor even entering the facility, they were still handling and preparing food to be served to the detainee population. ODO cited this as an Area of Concern. ODO interviewed supervisory staff and found Country Table and the facility were not equipped with a kosher kitchen, nor did they maintain any pre-made kosher diet trays. ODO noted there were no detainees receiving a kosher diet at the time of the inspection, nor had the facility received any requests for a kosher diet within the previous 12 months. ODO cited the facility’s lack of preparedness for any detainees who may need a kosher diet in the future as an Area of Concern. ODO inspected licensed medical staff credential files and found expired licenses for physician assistant and registered nurses (Deficiency MC-110). ODO noted there was no lapse in individual credentials; however, the above-mentioned staff failed to provide updated credentials to the HSA for record keeping. ODO reviewed 12 detainee files and found a consent form in all the files for general health care services. The form was supposed to have the detainees print their names at the top of the form and then sign the bottom of the form during the intake screening process. However, eight out of twelve consent forms did not include the detainees’ names printed at the top of the form. Hence, ODO could not verify if the detainees read the consent statement prior to signing. ODO cited this as an Area of Concern. ODO reviewed 12 detainee medical files and found the detainees had access to routine dental care, including dental cleanings, at their request. ODO was informed there was an on-site dentist available three days a week. Additionally, the medical records revealed 129 detainee dental examinations and treatments in 2019, and 48 detainees had been examined and treated thus far in 2020. The NDS 2019 standard requires routine examinations and care upon extended incarceration periods of six months or greater. The reported average detainee length of stay at KCJ is 28 days. KCJ made routine dental care available upon request at any time based on the detainees’ perceived need, and not necessarily based on the length of detention, which exceeds standard requirements. ODO cited this as a Best Practice.", "ACTIVITIES": "ODO reviewed the facility’s written policy and found no mention of the observance of religious holy days (Deficiency RP-111). ODO reviewed the facility’s detainee handbook and found visitation rules but no visitation hours (Deficiency V-112).

ODO reviewed the facility’s visiting hours and found visits were not allowed on Sundays and Mondays and if a holiday fell on either day visits were not allowed (Deficiency V-415). ODO reviewed how detainee visits were conducted at the KCJ. General visits were conducted via video visitation at the facility and off-site during visitation hours using a visitation software, which could be downloaded on the Apple and/or Google Play app stores. The software allows for a detainees’ family to be able to contact the detainee from anywhere in the United States with an internet connection during normal visitation hours. ODO cited this helpful technology as a Best Practice.", "JUSTICE": "ODO reviewed the facility’s policies and procedures and found KCJ did not provide detainees with the rules and procedures for requesting legal reference materials not maintained in the law library.

ODO found 11 deficiencies in the remaining seven standards and three Areas of Concern. ODO commends facility staff for their responsiveness during this inspection. In addition, ODO noted two Best Practices and commends the facility for their due diligence for going above and beyond the scope of the standard to provide premier services for detainees. ODO was very concerned with KCJ’s lack of a SAAPI program. Upon learning of the nonexistent SAAPI program, ODO immediately briefed the facility and ICE/ERO Chicago staff of the issue. By the end of the inspection, KCJ provided to ODO a draft SAAPI policy, which would emphasize zero tolerance of sexual abuse and/or assault of detainees within the facility.

A RN obtained a fasting blood glucose reading on the detainee and documented the results on the medication record as 129 mg/dl; however, ODO found no documented evaluation. Two days later, the RN documented on the clinical encounter form that the fasting blood glucose reading was 121mg/dl since the reading was normal no orders nor follow up was needed. The detainee should have had two consecutive early morning, fasting blood glucose readings and obtaining a symptom screen to diagnosis prediabetes or diabetes, which was not performed. ODO reviewed the medical files of the two other detainees and found the detainees had documented high blood pressure readings on their initial physical examinations. One detainee was seen on February 18, 2020, and had a reading of 152/90. The other detainee was seen on March 24, 2020, and had a reading of 150/99.

The most recent annual inspection conducted by the San Bernardino Health Department was on June 2, 2016 (Deficiency FS-214).\nCorrective Action: Prior to completion of the inspection, the facility initiated corrective action by having the San Bernardino Health Department complete an inspection of the food service facilities and equipment (C-2).\nNote: Over the course of the inspection, ODO toured both the West and East Unit kitchen areas and notes with concern the presence of numerous faucets in disrepair. The majority of faucets in these areas were actively leaking with significant amounts of water wasted. Senior facility staff indicated “hard” (i.e. mineral rich) water in the desert area caused the faucet gaskets to fail. Senior management also informed ODO the facility was in the process of seeking a new plumbing contractor.\nMEDICAL CARE (MC)\nMedical staff complete refusal forms whenever detainees refuse medication. In its reviews of medical files, ODO noted Medical Administration Records were properly completed and contained signed medication administration refusal forms when applicable. However, ODO observed a correctional officer hand a completed and signed refusal form (for mental health medication) to the nurse who stated that since the detainee did not come to pill line he refused medication. The detainee did not receive counseling as to the consequences of not adhering to mental health prescribed medications (Deficiency MC-115).\n14 “An independent, external inspector shall conduct annual inspections to ensure that the food service facilities and equipment meet governmental health and safety codes.” See ICE PBNDS 2011, Standard, Food Service, Section (V)(J)(13).

However, ODO notes the AFOD confirmed all staff had in fact been trained, and ODO’s observations during the inspection indicated staff members were proficient in these areas. ODO recommends the facility update its training accordingly and also provide the Contracting Officer’s Representative (COR) with the necessary records as required under the ICE contract.\n\nNWDC developed and coded a daily tracking mechanism to identify and monitor victims and abusers. This tracker is first populated during intake and updated daily thereafter. The tracker automatically feeds the facility housing restriction report by highlighting those detainees who cannot be housed in the same unit. Housing unit officers are informed immediately when a detainee’s status changes to ensure proper attention and prevention measures are in place. ODO recognizes this as a Best Practice.\n\nUpon entry into SMU, each detainee is provided an administrative or disciplinary segregation orientation sheet that summarizes all activities, programs, rules, services, and schedules while confined in SMU. This one-page, two-sided orientation sheet was developed by the SMU Lieutenant. ODO recognizes this orientation sheet and process as a Best Practice.\n\nNWDC has a SMU multi-disciplinary administrative review team that meets weekly to discuss all cases in SMU. This team consists of the Warden, Associate Warden, Major and/or Captain, SMU Lieutenant, AFOD or ERO designee, and Mental Health/Medical supervisor. ODO attended this weekly meeting during the inspection and found all attendees to be engaged and the issues presented to be very thoroughly covered. ODO recognizes this as a Best Practice.\n\nNWDC has a Correctional Emergency Response Team (CERT) comprised of (b) (7)(E ) specially trained officers. According to the AFOD and CERT Commander, GEO Corporate issued a directive recently that only CERT members will be trained on use of force team techniques. In accordance with the Use of Force and Restraints standard, section (V)(D)(1)(h), \"all new officers shall be sufficiently trained during their first year of employment on forced cell move techniques.\" Although ODO is not citing this as a deficiency because NWDC training currently meets this standard, ODO notes this as an Area of Concern.

Registered nurses (RNs) conduct health assessments for healthy detainees not taking medication. However, ODO’s review of training files for the RNs found training to conduct health assessments is conducted by mid-level practitioners (MLPs) and not a physician as required by the standard (Deficiency MC-18).\n\nThroughout this inspection ODO observed excellent interdisciplinary communication between medical, administrative staff, the AFOD, legal counsel, the Contracting Officer’s Representative (COR), and correctional staff. A weekly \"stakeholders meeting\" is conducted to keep administrative and ICE staff informed of significant medical/mental health cases requiring special attention, e.g. chronic care patients, detainees on suicide watch, and detainees advanced in age. These practices allow staff to make informed and timely decisions regarding detainee care to include transfers, releases, and/or ordering specialized care.

However, the facility grievance policy does not ensure emergency medical grievances are received by the administrative health authority within 24 hours or the next business day (Deficiency GS-19).", "CONCLUSION": "During this inspection, ODO reviewed the facility’s compliance with sixteen (16) standards and found the facility compliant with eleven (11) standards. ODO found four (4) deficiencies in the remaining four (4) standards, including one (1) repeat deficiency. While the staff members initiated immediate corrective action in one area, ODO recommends ERO work with facility personnel to remedy all remaining deficiencies, as applicable and in accordance with contractual obligations.\n\nIn addition to NWDC having almost as many best practices as it did deficiencies, which is highly unusual, ODO would like to highlight the working relationship between ERO and facility staff. The AFOD is actively involved in the facility’s day-to-day operations and participates on a variety of committees and working groups tasked with providing individualized and meaningful services. ODO commends facility and ERO staff for such active engagement and recognizes this attentive relationship is critical to effective operations."}, {"Detention Center": "Northwest Detention Center", "Inspection Type": "Compliance Inspection", "URL": "http://www.ice.gov/doclib/foia/odo-compliance-inspections/2014NorthwestDetentionCenterTacomaWaSep82014.pdf", "Inspection Date": "June 24–26, 2014", "Field Office": "Seattle Field Office", "Announced vs Unannounced": "N/A", "Environmental Health and Safety": "N/A", "Admission and Release": 3, "Custody Classification": 0, "System Facility": "N/A", "Security and Control": "N/A", "Funds and Personal Property": 0, "Post Orders": "N/A", "Searches of Detainees": "N/A", "Use of Force and Restraints": 0, "Special Management Units": 3, "Staff-Detainee Communication": 0, "Sexual Abuse and Assault Prevention and Intervention": 1, "Food Service": 3, "Hunger Strikes": "N/A", "Medical Care": 5, "Personal Hygiene Significant": "N/A", "Self-Harm and Suicide Prevention and Intervention": 0, "Correspondence and Other Mail": "N/A", "Religious Practices": "N/A", "Telephone Access": 1, "Voluntary Work Program": 0, "Grievance System": 2, "Law Libraries and Legal Materials": 0, "Detention Files Detainee Transfers": "N/A", "Total Deficiencies": 20, "Interviews Conducted": 40, "Interview Attempts Failed": 0, "SAFETY": "N/A", "SECURITY": "N/A", "CARE": "N/A", "ACTIVITIES": "N/A", "JUSTICE": "N/A", "CONCLUSION": "N/A"}, {"Detention Center": "Northwest Detention Center", "Inspection Type": "Compliance Inspection", "URL": "http://www.ice.gov/doclib/foia/odo-compliance-inspections/2014NorthwestDetentionCenterTacomaWaJune24-26.pdf", "Inspection Date": "June 24–26, 2014", "Field Office": "Seattle Field Office", "Announced vs Unannounced": "N/A", "Environmental Health and Safety": "N/A", "Admission and Release": 3, "Custody Classification": 0, "System Facility": "N/A", "Security and Control": "N/A", "Funds and Personal Property": 0, "Post Orders": "N/A", "Searches of Detainees": "N/A", "Use of Force and Restraints": 0, "Special Management Units": 3, "Staff-Detainee Communication": 0, "Sexual Abuse and Assault Prevention and Intervention": 1, "Food Service": 3, "Hunger Strikes": "N/A", "Medical Care": 5, "Personal Hygiene Significant": "N/A", "Self-Harm and Suicide Prevention and Intervention": 0, "Correspondence and Other Mail": "N/A", "Religious Practices": "N/A", "Telephone Access": 1, "Voluntary Work Program": 0, "Grievance System": 2, "Law Libraries and Legal Materials": 0, "Detention Files Detainee Transfers": "N/A", "Total Deficiencies": 20, "Interviews Conducted": 40, "Interview Attempts Failed": 0, "SAFETY": "N/A", "SECURITY": "N/A", "CARE": "N/A", "ACTIVITIES": "N/A", "JUSTICE": "N/A", "CONCLUSION": "N/A"}, {"Detention Center": "Northwest Detention Center", "Inspection Type": "Compliance Inspection", "URL": "http://www.ice.gov/doclib/foia/odo-compliance-inspections/2012northwest-detention-center-tacoma-wa-jan10-12.pdf", "Inspection Date": "January 10 – 12, 2012", "Field Office": "Seattle Field Office", "Announced vs Unannounced": "N/A", "Environmental Health and Safety": "N/A", "Admission and Release": "N/A", "Custody Classification": "N/A", "System Facility": "N/A", "Security and Control": "N/A", "Funds and Personal Property": 0, "Post Orders": "N/A", "Searches of Detainees": 0, "Use of Force and Restraints": 2, "Special Management Units": 0, "Staff-Detainee Communication": 0, "Sexual Abuse and Assault Prevention and Intervention": "N/A", "Food Service": 0, "Hunger Strikes": "N/A", "Medical Care": 0, "Personal Hygiene Significant": 0, "Self-Harm and Suicide Prevention and Intervention": "N/A", "Correspondence and Other Mail": 0, "Religious Practices": "N/A", "Telephone Access": 0, "Voluntary Work Program": "N/A", "Grievance System": 0, "Law Libraries and Legal Materials": 0, "Detention Files Detainee Transfers": "N/A", "Total Deficiencies": 3, "Interviews Conducted": 66, "Interview Attempts Failed": 0, "SAFETY": "N/A", "SECURITY": "N/A", "CARE": "N/A", "ACTIVITIES": "N/A", "JUSTICE": "N/A", "CONCLUSION": "N/A"}], "location_latitude": 32.5750242, "location_longitude": -116.9147637, "location_address": "7488 Calzada de la Fuente, San Diego, CA 92154", "location_field_office": "San Diego Field Office", "location_source": "csv_facilities", "name_similarity_score": 0.8076923076923077, "matched_facility_name": "Otay Mesa Detention Center", "generated_summary": "A 2017 inspection of the Northwest Detention Center (NWDC) revealed a mix of critical deficiencies and commendable practices.

Emergency power generators are inspected weekly; however, they are not operationally tested every two weeks for one hour (Deficiency EH&S-1). Note: The California Air Quality Management District limits the testing of power generators to 20 hours per year for maintenance. ODO found the SACJ’s Material Safety Data Sheets (MSDS’s) were up-to-date and readily available throughout the facility, to include a master index with a legend depicting the MSDS’s and the hazardous substances as well as their locations. ODO’s review of hazardous material inventory documents found the inventories to be accurate, complete and readily available in all areas except the facility laundry area which contained hazardous materials but no inventory (Deficiency EH&S-2). All SACJ’s areas and shifts participate in multiple fire drills throughout the year. ODO’s review of fire drill documentation found that although emergency keys are drawn during fire drills, SACJ does not document the time keys are drawn from the central control center and their arrival at the emergency doors (Deficiency EH&S-3). ODO’s observation of the medical department’s procedures regarding sharps confirmed that medical sharps are inventoried at shift change and verified monthly by the Health Service Administrator (HSA). However, a review of the inventory counts found that the inventory of lancets, 23 gauge syringes, and 25 gauge syringes were not accurate and did not match the physical counts (Deficiency EH&S-4).", "SECURITY": "During ODO detainee interviews, ten detainees complained of being strip searched upon arrival, after contact attorney visits or both. ODO’s subsequent review of the detainee’s files, found that SACJ has a blanket strip search practice in place, which requires all detainees to be strip searched when they arrive for processing from another facility or when they return from court or an attorney visit, if not supervised by SACJ personnel (Deficiency A&R-1). ODO interviewed transgendered detainees and multiple SACJ staff and found no medical personnel are present to observe the strip search of transgendered detainees (Deficiency A&R-2). As part of the intake assessments, classification staff takes into account the detainee’s gender self-identification. However, ODO interviewed the classification officer, classification supervisor and medical SME and found that a medical or mental health professional is not consulted on the classification assessment of transgendered individuals (Deficiency CCS-1). ODO’s review of the housing roster, tour of the housing units, and multiple SACJ staff interviews confirmed that detainees in the corresponding gay, transgender and sex-offender housing units found detainees are not housed according to their classification levels. Instead housing units contained detainees from all custody levels, separated solely by their confining offense or sexual orientation, resulting in low, medium-low, medium-high, and high custody detainees being co-mingled within units (Deficiency CCS-2). ODO’s review of the facility reclassification policy (02.04) found SACJ allows responses to reclassification requests to be provided up to 96 hours after the initial request is received when submission occurs on a Friday and when/if the classification officer is off duty (Deficiency CCS-3). ODO’s review of the facility handbook found it does not notify detainees no cash is allowed within the facility or that detainees may access personal funds to pay for legal services. The handbook also fails to inform detainees that they may obtain a certified copy of any identification document held by ICE/ERO in their A-file, what the procedure is for claiming property upon release, or identify the procedure for filing a claim regarding lost/damaged property (Deficiency F&PP-1). Each detainee is provided a bin to store permitted personal property within the housing unit. However, ODO’s inspection of the bins found they are not securable. (Deficiency F&PP-2). ODO’s review of the facility handbook and F&PP procedures found that possession of jewelry is prohibited including wedding rings which are confiscated during the admissions process and stored with the detainee’s property (Deficiency F&PP-3). ODO found the facility policy on sexual abuse prevention and intervention (06.16) includes zero tolerance for all forms of sexual abuse or assault. However, the policy does not require that any allegation, made to staff of sexual assault or attempted sexual assault, be reported immediately to a supervisor and to ERO (Deficiency SAAPI-1). ODO’s review of the facility’s training curriculum found it to include procedures for reporting incidents and allegations. However, ODO found the training did not include instruction on sexual abuse and/or assault never being an acceptable consequence of detention or the recognition of situations where sexual abuse and/or assault may occur (Deficiency SAAPI-2). SACJ uses the Jail Management System (JMS) to record all detainee activities within the SMU. ODO’s review of recreation log entries made in the JMS indicates officers are not consistently recording the time the detainee left the cell, the time the detainee returned to the cell, or if an SMU detainee refused to participate in recreation. A review of the JMS log found that the log entries regarding recreation time were inconsistent. Therefore, ODO could not confirm if detainees in administrative segregation were receiving the optimal level of two hours per day of recreation, seven days a week, or that disciplinary segregation detainees were receiving their one hour per day in accordance with the optimal provisions the facility is contractually-obligated to provide (Deficiency SMU-1).", "CARE": "ODO’s review of the facility’s food service menu found that the SACJ utilizes a 28-day menu cycle containing 2,800 calories. (Deficiency FS-1). However, the menu is certified by a registered dietitian for its nutritional adequacy. ODO’s interview of food service staff members found that although several employees reported receiving medical screenings following ODO’s 2013 compliance inspection to correct the then-identified deficiency; the facility was unable to provide any documentation to verify that health screenings were completed on all food service personnel (Deficiency FS-2). ODO’s review of 30 electronic medical records (EMR) found that the intake screening form used by SACJ does not include a requirement for the screener to inquire about a transgender detainee's gender identication and the history of transition-related care (Deficiency MC-1).", "ACTIVITIES": "ODO’s operational checks of the SACJ detainee phone system found that it has an automated setup to electronically monitor all detainee telephone calls. Detainees are notified of telephone monitoring in the facility handbook and postings near most of the telephones. In addition to the handbook and postings, an automated verbal proclamation is announced to both the detainee and the recipient that the conversation is being recorded and may be monitored. Though detainees may make unmonitored telephone calls, the procedures to do so were not consistently posted near all detainee telephones in English and Spanish (Deficiency TA-1). ODO’s tour of the detainee housing units found that although telephone access rules are provided to detainees upon admittance via orientation and the facility handbook, the hours for telephone access are not posted consistently near all telephones (Deficiency TA-2). ODO found that of the six units housing ICE detainees, only the SMU had the hours for telephone access posted. ODO’s use of the SACJ’s translation and interpretation language line verified the availability of services; however, these services are not always provided as needed (Deficiency TA-3). ODO used the SACJ Language Line Service to interview a detainee who had been housed at the SACJ for approximately 143 days (at the time of inspection) and found that the detainee claimed not to understand English or Spanish. The detainee claimed she only spoke Creole and French. The detainee claimed, via an interpreter, that only the medical department used the language line to communicate with her. All other communications with the facility and field office staff were supposedly communicated by way of hand gestures. ODO interviews with facility staff confirmed that housing unit officers conduct daily safety and security rounds, as well as inspections of the housing unit dayroom. ODO tested phones in these areas and found them all to be in working order. However, ODO found that no designated staff member inspects the detainee telephones daily to promptly report out-of-order phones for service and/or repair (Deficiency TA-4).", "JUSTICE": "ODO reviewed 15 randomly selected detainee files and found four of the files were lacking a receipt acknowledgement formverifying the detainee’s receipt of the local supplement (Deficiency DH-1). Corrective Action: Prior to completion of the inspection each detainee was issued the particular handbook which they were missing and their signed receipt acknowledgement forms were added to their detention file (C-1). ODO reviewed the local supplement and found that it does not notify detainees of: the facility’s marriage request procedures; the contact information for the field Office including the scheduled hours and days that ERO staff are available to be contacted; the procedures for detainees to submit written questions, requests, or concerns to ERO; or the availability of assistance to prepare such requests (Deficiency DH-2). Corrective Action: Prior to completion of ODO’s inspection, the facility initiated corrective action by updating the information in the local supplement in preparation for the next reprint. The facility also posted memos informing detainees of this information throughout the detainee housing units and other prominent detainee common areas (C-2). ODO’s tour of the facility found that each detainee housing unit has a law library co-located within the unit, consisting of a single computer equipped with the latest version of Lexis Nexis installed and dated July 25, 2016. However, lists of the law library’s holdings, or the hours of access, were not consistently posted in all of the housing unit law libraries (Deficiency LL&LM-1).
